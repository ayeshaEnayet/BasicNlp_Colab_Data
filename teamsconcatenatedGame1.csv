I have so many cards to give and no one to give them to because I'm a million miles away..Oh um I can use Helicopter Lift and move you to our side..That would just be gorgeous so I can- ok and then so I guess that counts as one move for me..Mm. Helicopter Lift does not that's not an action so you still have all three. That's one, that's two..Oh ok. ok, so one and two. Um..Awesome..And then I am going to move back over here in hopes that- well I guess it would't matter but we could attempt at some point to save this ok.

So your turn..Alright..Alright you have two of those.Ok..I will.First move..I'll meet you there..Ok..Um..I can't shore up..If I gave you....If I gave the Engineer Ocean's.Chalice.Y-.Would that.I mean it might help but you could also do that without being on my square..Cause you have that one.Yeah..It'd be better to give him a card than.The rest of us..I think it makes sense to kinda like.Well you have two fires already we can only have five.Mmhmm..So..(yeah).I'll hold on to it for now..Mmhmm..Um.I don't think there's really.I think that there's nothing to do really except like shore this up cause.(any).Yeah I can't really.like we don't have enough treasures to make anything happen..So you could move again?.Yeah..So yeah I would move..Um..down to Breaker's Bridge and shore it up, cause I don't think there's anything we can do..No I can't do, I can't do diagonal..No, no, if you just go down, cause you still have two left..No..It's adjacent..I don't think there's anything like.to do this turn cause we don't have any treasures..No I just mo- I move there..So that's one..Already.You can move one more time..And then you can move once more and then shore it up..Oh ok..Ok..Alright..Getting the hang of this now..Alright that's it for me..(alright).And then you get like your two treasures.Oh yeah..Let's see..Earth Stone and Sandbags..Ok..Does he.then.You got..Oh..I guess.You got a.Just.Draw two of them.

Oh that didn't.didn't it say like special actions don't count as that..Mmhmm..Sp.That doesn't count as an action..Oh yeah, Helicopter and Sandbags..doesn't count as.an action.Yeah..No that's ok..Ok..But you can still.I don't, I don't need to, I don't need to use an action.Yeah..Yeah..But.Ok..Yeah..Alright..I.So I could fly all of us some place I don't think I need to do that, you don't need to move yet right?.Yup..Oh.I don't think you can give that to, oh yea you got to get your treasure..Hold on, hold on, I need to.I always forget to do that. Ok Water's Rise..Oh..so three this time.Ok.Wait, wait, wait, we gotta shuffle them back in..Yeah..I can't.Can't shuffle them like a normal deck of cards.Ok we got.Breaker's Bridge, Whispering Garden and Iron Gate..So Iron.Iron Gate..Iron Gate is gone.Whispering Garden and then Breaker's Bridge.here..Ok..Ok..Ok..I should fly to a different island and.Get these back..Shore them up again..Right?.Mm.I don't.Um, yeah..Yeah..I think you can just, you can just shore them up without using the lift thought..But yeah.No, no. I but I can fly anyway..so.Oh, right, right..Yeah..that's.yeah.So that's.so that's.That's two.Two..Three cause I'm gonna hold off giving you a card..Yeah..Yeah..So I got.A couple too many..Alright..Ahh.Anything else?.All of them are shored up..Yeah..Um then you just have to.Mm.Yeah, I think we're just collecting treasures and just keeping things shored up for now..Ok, I gotta a sandbag..Yeah..Everything's shored up..(Duh).And one of these.Yes..ok.So I next move I give you.Er.Then to give you that one..Ok um..Three of these..Mmhmm.Yeah..Yeah..Let's just hope.for.Wait.Ok..Yeah..It's three of them yeah.That's three..Ok.Alright, Lost Lagoon.Oh.Cliffs of Abandon and the Temple of Moon.Um.Cliffs of Abandon right here in the middle.Here.Go ahead.And.Then.And the Lost Lagoon.Over there..Oh.Alright..Ok..Great..Umm..So I'm gonna give.this to them.Oh you have six cards you have to.Get rid of one..ah.Do these count?.I guess so.Um..Yeah..Ok..I'll get rid of.I think you should get rid of the sandbag.cause.Yeah cause we don't need that.Good thinking.And.Oh wait can we get rid of tre-are there more than, if there more than four of a kind of treasures which there must be I think it's actually safe to get rid of treasures.There's probably eight..Yeah..Yeah I think it's safe to get rid of like.You can get rid of.a treasure.Are there more than four of these? (--).There must be the deck is huge..Alright..We willing to take that chance?.Mmm.Yeah I think so..Let's go for it..What could possibly go wrong?.Yeah I don't know..Might be at the bottom..Yeah we could hit the bottom because.Sandbags seems better..Well we have two..This is the one we need right?.w-.Two oceans, three earths, four fires.To be honest, I think you just might want to get rid of the fire..Cause like.Odds are by the time.it gets.back around to someone.We'll have drawn another one.And you can just use the sandbag.now.Mm.So what you're saying is we should assume that there's more there but if there's not.Well like the deck is huge, how could there not be..then we're.I don't know.Ok..No but we.If she gives you that one then we get rid of all.all four of those..When we get the treasure..Oh the other thing is if we.Because I could fly and if we could all get on the same one then I could fly us.Here.Yeah.And then.We could have that.Treasure off.Yeah and all those cards would be gone..Mmhmm.And the-, right..Yeah.What's.I think.Oh Gosh..Yeah I think it's better just to start getting treasures off the island.Yeah..Let's, yeah get stuff out of the way..Ok yeah I think you should..Better safe than sorry.And then we won't have to worry about.Yeah I guess just get rid of the sandbag then..Then we won't have to worry about either of those to tiles to shore up..Yeah..Because this one it seems that.I think we're already shoring everything up fine..We're doing pretty good anyway..Yeah..That's kind of.Yeah..Ugh if I, if I'd been thinking though like if I'd played this like.You could have just given me this anyway and then I could have gotten rid of.these two.cause I'm sure there are a ton of them, the deck is like, it's like a hundred cards.yeah.ok you know what, we're gonna find out.alright.probably by this next time.yeah, let's let's keep going.alright.So let's see.Ah I'll just.Hm.Ok I'll just give you a card actually, I'll give you.Yeah then I'll be, then I'll be at max.this.I'll give you.this.shore up.this.And go here.Um.And then I get two treasure cards.if one of them's a fire then we already have enough.then we'll see what's goin' on.nope.I got six so I got to get rid of one of them.Um.I'll get rid of.he's good.we could.we could now have four of these.either it's just.alright so I'll get rid of.the chalice.it's up to chance so either one.get rid of the chalice.yeah.it also said that we only had to have.three of them right so we could just kind of.chose a treasure to abandon.Mmhmm.right now.so we should just go for this and this and I guess the gold ones we'll just.Um.well actually we would have had.Ok.Um.we probably should have gotten rid of this because then he would have had two and it would have been real easy to give him the third one.Does that make any sense.you could.oh.He would have had three.Umm.yeah.it does.oops.ok.it's ok.oh it's ok.we're fine.I think we're gonna win.Ah.We have twenty one.we have twenty one minutes plenty of time.Copper Gate.is.there.Crimson.Forest is there.And then Howling Garden.And Howling Garden.Alright it doesn't matter if the Howling Garden gets flooded also though cause this one's closer.And it's at the edge of the board so like we're not going to be crossing through.yeah.ok.Alright you're there s-.Umm.(--).It's yeah ah um.Oh.(laughs).Let's see.Should I.I kinda like the idea of.Hmmm.Right now you use your Helicopter lift.to fly yourself there.Uh huh.And then he spends his turn just giving you these two.she has five cards.yeah but if you use the Helicopter.Oh.yeah.well actually if I used the Helicopter lift then it would go off.Oh you'd still have six.And then I'd yeah.You still have one.But I'm.Alright.And then I'd only have three I wouldn't have four.You're the one that's gonna.yeah we need to focus on the fire.yeah.I'm on the fire with three of them so you just have to give me one.yeah.Uh huh.When it's your turn.and that's gonna be my turn.And then you can get rid of one of those yeah.Mmhmm..Alright, you're here now?.So.Can I just shore up?.Well the only way you could shore up is to move one two.I can do.or one, if you move over here then can't you shore up that one?.Cause it's adjacent?.Yeah maybe you should go one two and shore this up to make sure this doesn't flood..cause.yeah cause this one.if this one.gets um.um.I forget what you call it.No this is still shored up.Yeah, yeah but if in if the chance we lose this one, we won't be able to get to this one..this one's ok.yeah.So.Yeah I like just going there cause you can still give.If I do that, ok.things long distance.yeah.Yeah..Alright.this.one, two.ok.three.we'll grab two treasures.there's.water's rise.more than three.Water's Rise, I gotta shuffle these in..yeah shuffle, I- can you- I'll get rid of this one..Two, yeah..Breaker's Bridge, Lost Lagoon and Whispering Garden.Whispering Garden.Where's Lagoon?.Lost Lagoon is lost..Lost Lagoon..Ok..And.Um..And what was the other one?.Breaker's.Bridge.Where's that?.There it is..Alright, that's it for me..Ok..Alright so.I'm gonna shore this up.No we need you to give that, we need you to give me this.Ok..this turn.I no no.But you have to be.you need to be on my square though.So.Um.if on same.You can shore.so I think you can shore up one of these then fly over to me then give me one.Yeah.Alright, it's a good thing you got all that done.s-.So I think shore up the.Alright this one or this one?.Shore up this one cause it's a treasure.Mmhmm.One..Then fly to me.two..two..and then give me.and then card.that.three.Alright and I have to get rid of.get rid of the yellow one?.Um..Cause this one we don't have four of right now..Yeah let's do that.Mmhmm..So.Get rid of that.Alright..Ah.And then I can use the Helicopter Lift and get you.Over here since you got all four.No I'm supposed to be here.I have to be here. This is when we have all when we have.Oh but then d- oh we all have to go.Yeah.That's when we have all of them yeah.but you should use your Helicopter Lift and go somewhere..Um..Because you're gonna have six cards after you draw.yeah you're gonna have to.Alright then I should.Um..Move some place where I can shore up one of these.So maybe go like here where you can shore something up but you aren't in danger of drowing..Alright.Or.This one?.Or actually wait you can go on top, yeah I like that.or.Do we need this one?.We have.I think this one.yeah I think go here go here.Ok why this one?.Yeah..Cause it doesn't matter if this sinks.Cause we're still gonna have.This tile to get rid of our.We just have to be careful because Whispering Garden is in the top.our winds.Right..So.Yeah..But the thing is like it does- like if she goes here and it goes under she just ends up here anyway it's like fine..Ok..So there's just like a slight maybe benefit maybe..Alright..Yeah..But you can't.shore it up.we'll see.d- wait, wait do I have to.you can't shore it up, you're out of actions.there.yeah..So it's.Ok.Yeah..Here and then here.Alright and then two treasures.Alright..Yep.Hey you got another Helicopter Lift.Two of these good..The Helicopter (came).Alright, I need three Floods..Here you go.What.Copper Gate, Howling Gardens.And Cliffs of Abandon.Alright, so that one's.Ok..That one's gone..Cliffs.Alright, we need that, that's a possibility.and then.This one too.Oh well..Ok..That's naive.Swim to.An adjacent place and it's up to you which.Alright, I'm gonna swim to.Sure..(Straight by the) (--).Alright..So I'm using these four?.Um..I guess we just put them in the discard pile?.We've.yeah..Captured this.Alright.So that's one..two.and then this is my third.Ok..Can I get two treasures?.Oh this is really convenient.Oh ok Yeah.Yeah I know..Cause you can just give me those two and then I'm already here.Ok ah, three..Cave of Embers is over there.Temple of the Moon and Crimson Forest.is gone..(Alright) and we lost that..But, who cares..that doesn't change anything.Wait give me the card.Yeah we have the.Oh right..Crimson Forest right?.Ok..Mmhmm.Um..Ok..Alright is that it?.yeah.Ok..Two.Um, we'll go ahead and shore that up I think..Three.this one?.Yeah, shore this up and then.Yeah..So that's one..If you just give me those two green ones, when it's my turn next I can just.Um.Pack those away also.Can I do multiple? Give treasure cards to, it says cards..Alright..Oh one action per card ok, so if I gave you both then I'd be un-.So then you're.Yeah and then.Um done, do I need.But do you need any other actions?.Nope, uh everything's shored up except for Cave of Embers and it doesn't matter if that goes under cause we've already got this..I don't think so..Oh yeah, ok.But.Oh.Alright so I'll do that, one, two, three for me then.Alright..And then.Oh and then.that frees me up.Mm k..And then.Coral Palace, Dunes of Deception and Silver Gate..Silver Gate.Coral Palace.Coral Palace.Um the yeah..Dunes of Deception.Did we lose one?.NnMm..No, everything's still good.Ok..Alright..Alright..Uh move here so I can shore this up..Um.Yeah.We gotta be safe..Yeah, that'd be good..That's one..That's two..Oh.Um..And then..What if you just fly oh you go- what if you just go here and then next turn he gives you these two?.And then I shore.Yeah..Yeah..Yeah..Alright..(Alright).yeah I think we're gonna win in like a couple turns..Three.Alright..We have twelve minutes still..yeah..Alright..So you get your two..Yeah..I'm gonna be..Alright and I have too many cards so I can.discard these.You can get rid of this one..cause we have.red, we're gonna get green.ok..And then you're gonna get yellow next so purple doesn't matter anymore..Neither of these matter. This one doesn't matter either..Yeah..Yeah..Yeah..Yeah..Alright..Cool..Alright..Here you go.Ok Temple of the Sun..Tidal Palace.and.Temple of the Sun.also doesn't matter.Oh what am I doing?.And Bronze.I just turned that over.yeah just turn it over.Temple of the Sun and Bronze Gate.And Bronze Gate.Alright.Alright.Alright.So I turn it these four.Ah.That's one.Ah.I don't think there's anything.Do we need to sh-shore anything else?.Umm..I don't think there's anything left for me to do, I think I can just kinda hang here now, right?.And just wait for you guys to end the game in a couple turns?.Alright..I guess, well that was one, I might as well just do two..Three.Just.to be safe?.Just to be safe.Yeah.Just to be safe.Ok..Perfect..Just so we've got alright.Alright..Ah.Alright.Two.Two treasures.Yeah.Uh.A Helicopter and a Water's Rise.Oh perfect.Bump it up to three..Ok..Silver Gate.is.gone.here's those two..Whispering Garden.And Temple of.the Sun which I shored up.so that.was.a good thing.that's good..Alright.Alright so I'm giving you.Well you have five cards don't you.He's got.Yeah but she doesn't care about the green one..Um.And he's got a Helicopter Lift also so I could get.Ok.(that).Oh wait, wait wait..Shore this up just to be super safe maybe?.That's me..Yeah wait, alright, I so.If you go one.If he moves there.Shore it up and then move here.then we're super safe and then she can just give those to you instead of you to her.cause you're on the same square.She can only give me one..No she can give you two..Unless I have two..It's two actions.Oh ok right. One action. Ok..I have two turns left..(Player) on the same.Yeah..So.So do that. One.One.Shore.Yeah cause that's our last gold one.And then.Three.Yeah.Ok..That's good..Mm k..I gotta draw..Um.I have four..You can get rid of.Any green ones.Yeah..You just get rid of your.Now you have three of those?.Yes.I have two, oh no I do have three, oops.No.Oh wow.so you have to get rid of.Mmhmm.Just get rid of the other green one too.yeah.And then three..Alright, Temple of the Moon, Tidal palace.and.Dunes of Desertion.Tidal Palace.That's Tidal ok.Alright, your turn..Ok..Ultimately I have to get us all..Over here now..Yeah we have here and then we have the have a Helicopter Lift..Alright..First action..Yeah.Yeah that's good..K..That's me..Oh..Oh ah well you can use the Helicopter Lift though.Yeah..Oh I think you should.No, no, I think we all wanna end up over here..Um.Wait, I think so, I think the plan is if you just fly to me right now, that's two..Yeah..And then you can just shore one up or something.And then when it's my turn.I'll lift us back over.cause we can us-we can use the lift at any time actually.Well we have three.We have have three so.We have three Helicopter Lifts.Yeah so we have plenty of time I think just.Fly over and shore up like.Dunes of Deception or something.And then.We might as well just do this one.Well that's two, so you can only shore up one of them.Yeah.And then.I guess I'm just wondering if we.Um.If.We don't really.What I'm thinking is if we end up on the same square then we win instantly when it's his turn.Mmhmm..Mmhmm..Cause.He takes the treasure.Then I helicopter lift us both over there.Then you Helicopter lift us over there and then you lift a third time.Ok..yeah.That's two..This one?.That's.Sure..yeah..Three..And another Sandbag.And Chalice.(--).I think you can just get rid of both of those.This.Just.Used it, you can use the.Or one.Well we can just use this.Or yeah.Sandbag right now.Yeah.And.Just to be safe.Just.I know it doesn't really matter.Bag up any ran- yeah any random one..whichever.there we go.three of those.Coral Palace.Cave of Embers.And Cliffs of Abandon.Here it is.Alright.Ok.End up yeah over here..Nope those are over there..So I'll go.One..Two..And then.Three to end up back with you.Just shore stuff up.I get two treasures but.I don't think it does anything.Ok..Alright.And then.The three Floods tiles.Yeah.Mm..Misty Marsh.Breaker's Bridge and Bronze Gate.So Bronze Gate is gone also.Here you go.Alright.So I'm doin'.So you grab.That.get this.I helicopter us over.yeah..And then.Um..You can just lift the three of us over here and then lift out of the island..So I guess we won..Mmhmm..Alright..Yeah..And with five minutes to spare.Water's Rise.he still has to do yeah.No we can- you can lift right now- you can lift when it's not your turn.Oh you can lift.So.it said you can do it anytime.Oh play at any time.Ok..Yeah.Alright.So.I guess we did it..and then the.the last lift out.and then this one.Brilliant..And I guess just put them there.",s,b  %

Or you can't shore up diagonal things..Um right here, should I move right here?.No- I don't.Um, I don't think it matters which one of these.Ok.you move to, just because we don't have enough to get a treasure right now..We don't have one of those anyways- Ok..Yeah.The only thing would be if you wanted to give us a card, you'd have to move to this one.which.Ok.Well you only have three actions anyway.so even.if you walked here you couldn't.give them cards..She can fly.Yeah..Yeah.Oh that's right, that's right..Yeah I don't think it matters..Ok.Ok, I'll just um.move here then.and then flip you guys over.Ok..Ok.Um.and then I'll have to use.all three of my actions, so.Mmhmm.I don't see why.I would..And then I pick up two of these right?.Yeah.Ok.OK.Thank you..Mmhmm.So, we're flooding Lost Lagoon and Cliffs of Abandon..Mmkay..Thank you.Mmhmm.Alright.uh.I can't flip both of these over.(--) flip that one now and that's probably the.Well.Yeah ok, never mind, yeah sorry.Yeah.And then.I kinda wanna stick around one of these, either this thing or this thing because.Mmkay.Mmhmm.Stay- Yeah. You should stay there because I can then give- I can give you another one..Yeah.Yeah.Right, right, right.Alright,.I guess I'm done..OK.Ok.Thanks.uhm.Um thanks.Ok.so.you definitely wanna keep that up..So.yeah I'll use my two actions to move.to.Wait, wait, wait.(--).hold on a second..Let's just think about this for a second..Uh.cause it's won't be very hard. I'll only need one action to move this up right?.But you're gonna need.Mmhmm.all three of your actions to move it up.Mmhmm.but I- That's true, you're right. I don't know if it'll like go anytime soon..Yeah.or, or we could use.the sandbag but I don't see a reason.Yeah.why.Yeah.and there's always this one too..You.That's true..Yeah.And I could like- I have a Helicopter though so I could fly one of you.to that one if you guys.Oh, ok.Yeah.whenever we need to do that..I do wanna give you this fire thing at some point though..Ok.I think that's important so we should.somehow try to get our pawns closer together..Mmhmm, so then it would be- Misty Marsh would be a good place for me to be..Yeah.So it'd be one away from you..Yeah, so I guess flipping this thing over is good and plus.What- I.Ok, I think it's a good move then. Cause we have people close enough, we can probably flip that next turn anyway..Mmhmm.Yeah.Ok.Ok, so what're you gonna do?.Yeah.so I'm going to move two.and then for my third action.shore this up..Ok.good..Mmhmm.Ok, Water's Rise..No.fun.Hooray.Fun.Ok.Ok.The good news is even if we lose one of these two it's not.a treasure..Ok.and then.discard.that.OK.And then.(--) ok.Alright..So I'll- my first move.Uh wait wait wait.we need to draw the water cards now right?.Or do we not.Oh, you're right..Yeah.Oh shit.Ok, so I draw another.sorry.three.Goodness..Great.Breaker's Bridge,.Alright.Temple of the Moon, and Whispering Garden..We didn't lose anything..Alright.We did Temple of the Moon, this is Breaker's Bridge..and.Oh this (--) ok.um.Ok.Ok.so.first.I'll give this to you.Explorer.Ok.hold on..I'll, I'll give that to you..Ok.so that means I have to definitely discard a card?.Oh, do you not want it then?.if that's ok..Oh.I don't know.I don't know.Oh, I see. Yeah, maybe you should hold onto that cause you only have.Mm.You want me to hold onto it?.Alright.Well then let's just think about it for a second,.Because.I really don't- Cause we have.Yeah a lot of those.four lions right? Which means we can get that card. We have four fires, which means we can get that card..Mmhmm.We only have three of this right now..Mmhmm.Yeah, just- I would just keep it..Ok.So yeah, yeah, I guess that's a good idea. And we need to.like we need to trade I think, yeah..Yeah.Ok.so.Uh.would- basically I should shore up something..Yeah.yeah, I think so..But.what.should that something be?.Uh.Well have you done an action yet?.So you have.I haven't done anything..No, she has three actions..Ok, so.can you shore up this one?.Do we wanna use a sandbag?.Already, no.Yeah, I forgot you had that..Um.I was just thinking like, like she can definitely shore up.these two, right. And then a third action would just be a movement.Mmhmm.Mmhmm.but then I wouldn't.shore up anything else and then the sandbag we don't have to use an action for. I'm just wondering if we should use it.I kind of feel like, I don't know, why not. You know what I mean?.Well the thing is.that I.um.you can't use- you can't- you can shore up a tile before it sinks but it can't be used if the flood deck card for the sinking tile is already drawn. So this is already here, so I can't do that..I see..Ok.Mm.That's the one rule that I.don't like.Well, no, I thought that was if you draw them both in the same turn.you can't use it to save it if it's going to.go..Yeah cause then- Couldn't we never use the sandbag.You can still- You can use it right now, but if the next time we draw flood cards.there's one for this one in that.group, you can't use it then..Ok, so if we break a rule.does the game end?.(--).I'm just asking, I don't know..Um, I thought so, no?.If we break a rule, I don't know.If we break a rule, does the game end?.I think so.Ok.No.ok.so I wasn't sure, I think.I think we might have screwed up before.I don't think you draw the flood cards again after you put them back on top of the deck..Are we allowed to clarify that?.Mmhmm.You can fly yourself.Ok.So we did it right then?.Yeah.Ok.Sandbags can shore up any one tile.Ok, cause it went up to three and then- ok.Ok so then can you use the sandbag card if, if the.So.water card is here?.Ok, so I know what my interpretation of that is but.It's already drawn.Yeah.What do you guys think?.I mean based, based on what they were.You disagree.But wouldn't that mean we can never use the sand bag? The only way things sink is if they're drawn- how.Right.Yeah.Isn't that kinda weird?.I mean, based, based on what they said on the video, I'm pretty sure they just mean you can't use it the turn.it's like you got a Water's Rise, you draw it, and then.Well if you, well if.you could use it if.the, these got- say these got shuffled back in.and this didn't get drawn again.Oh.Oh.then I could use it..Alright, I kinda see.So.Um.I think that interpretation's correct..ok.so I could um.We'll see.Ok.Alright, so you can shore up two tiles pretty much, when you're on the one adjacent to you..Right, so which one, which ones do you want me to- So I'm gonna shore up this one?.Yes.That's probably good, yeah..Yeah.Yeah, since it has the treasure on it, yeah..Cause we almost.Yeah.Ok,.and which other one?.Uh.I'd probably say the, the one in the.Breaker's Bridge, yeah..Yeah.towards the middle? Ok.Yeah cause a lot of ones on the side are like.we don't really need them..Mmkay so I have two of these.then I have to draw three..Ok, now we have four of those out..We have four (--) yeah.Ok, Iron Gate.That's gone.Cliffs of Abandon.this one and Lost Lagoon.and that's gone..Ok.Ok, so.I think that I should give this to you..Yes.Ok.but you guys have to be on the same thing.Yeah, you have to be on the same space as me to do that..Mmhmm,.oh I do, ok hold on.Yeah, yeah, yeah.Um where are you at?.You are blue.You're blue..I'm here so you could.So you can fly-.Ok.Two.yeah if you wanna fly to my spot..Oh yeah that's- Yeah.Ok.And then that way you could also.if that's your one action and then you could-.No you could shore up one of those two.And then I can give it to you..And then you can shore up- I would shore up that one probably..Oh nice.It's good..Yeah so I'll do this.And then I'll flip this over.and then I'll give this to you..Awesome, ok.Ok now I have five.and then.So on your turn I'm gonna give you this flame thing anyway.Right and I guess we can sacrficie the chalice?.Yeah.and that way you can.get a card when it's your turn- should be able to..Mmhmm.yeah and I have to give you the wind statue..Wait you don't necessarily have to.eventually..Fuck, you're not close enough yet though..sacrifice it though, you can give it to one of us, cause I don't have.Yeah, that's true..Oh, but look.If I give him this card.on my turn he has to sacrifice it cause he'll have six and he won't be able to like give it to anyone else, yup.Oh right.Mmhmm.Yeah.Mm.But I'm not sure you wanna do that just yet cause I still have to be on one of these spaces to get it..That's true..Yeah.Ok so um.Unless you wanna airlift me to it..I have to pick up two more of these right?.Oh that'd be so good..And I- So I pick up two of these.I think that's such a good idea..Uh huh.Well we'll see, she can use it on your turn..Ok.Ok.Ok.And you have.aw you don't, never mind..Ok so we're sinking Howling Garden, Crimson Forest, and Copper Gate.Copper Gate.uh.Uh huh.Ok.Thank you.(--).Alright so (--) you Explorer.Mm.Ok.Alright.so I do think we should probably get rid of the chalice right, we only need three out of the four things, we have four fire and four earth and four air.Ok.Mmhmm.So, I don't think the chalice really matters.At this point.uh I'm probably gonna move here.give you the fire card,.sacrifice the chalice.shore up- I guess I'm gonna shore up the Copper Gate..Ok.Wait.ok.Not three right?.Three actions.Yes, that's three, so now we can do.the uh.flood..Doesn't he have to draw treasure cards first?.oh.Or did you do.I don't think so..Mm no he didn't draw yet..Yeah.Ok.Thanks.Water's Rise.Beautiful.Yeah.That sucks..At least we didn't go up a level.Yup.Just prepare to lose one of these..Alright.Copper Gate,.Howling Garden,.This one.Ok.Dang it.It's gone..(--).So that's lost, alright..Ok.And the Bridge.That's not too bad..Yeah and Breaker's Bridge..Yeah.That's ok, we just can't lose this one, or else it's over..Yeah no.(--).Right.I really did not think we were gonna lose stuff so fast..Ok so now it's my turn..So.first things's.Ok so.Wait a minute.Do we wanna.do the helicopter thing and send him to one of the fire places and then.uh.he can get the treasure?.Because the cop- would only be one action right?.Yeah.I was gonna say what if he shores up these two?.Yeah I need to do that first..Yeah, yeah, yeah.And then flies..Ok.And then um.Mmhmm.Or.Um how can he fly?.Well.you have the Hel-.You have the Helicopter card..Cause the thing is, is.Yeah but I have to wait for my turn right?.I thought we could use it at anytime..No you can use them at anytime..I can use anytime? Ok..And since that doesn't count as an action.Well I was also gonna say.um.if you want to.Yeah.you can shore up that one as well..Alright..Or no you can't shore diagonally, never mind..No.Alright.Are we sure it can be used at anytime?.Yeah..I'm not..Uh, I thought.Ok.I don't really think it says- What does the card say?.Special action cards.action.Oh it does say play at anytime..Oh special action cards.Ok.that's fine..We're good..Ok.Yeah.so.Ok.Ok yeah so I'm gonna shore up.these two.Ok.and then you're going to fly me to which one?.Mmhmm.Which one should I go to?.Which one's more likely maybe mm.I was thinking this one cause it's closer to the bridge but.Because then you can shore up that?.I like that idea..whould you do that anyway on your turn? Ok.Yes, I would..Because I don't really have much to do..It's also close to the.But look.this..I was gonna say this is like a nice little cluster of all the treasures, so if anything starts getting flooded.two.yeah.Yeah.it'll be easy for you to shore things up when you're near there..that's a good point. That one is only near a, a chalice,.Yeah.but this one also is..And we're not going for that..Yeah.And this is the only place we have the.Yeah.wind statue thing now.Yeah, ok.Ok.Mmhmm.that's a good point..Oh so that's only one of my actions.(--).discard.Oh.There we go..For my second I'll trade these in for a treasure.OK.Cool..Cool..Yay.Um.and then I could, I could move..Should I move.just here so I'm ready to do that next time?.Um.I mean you can if you want.Maybe.it's not like we.need to be on this anymore..Well here.or.or.do.Mm see you have a lot of the.cards..Yeah, so.He could give you.this and you can discard your fire card..I can't, I'm not on the same space as him..You're on the same space..Oh shoot, sorry, I keep- Like it's my power, I keep forgetting..Right.(--).it's alright.Yeah.Ok.It might be better if you're.here, just because.if anything gets.poten- like potentially flooded or whatever, you have.Yeah.Yeah, you have the ability to flip over more things, shore up more things..Yeah cause this.right now, these- this is (--) protect that and.Yeah, yeah, yeah.Yeah, that's good..Ok, so I'll move here for my last one..That's good..Ok.Ok, so two treasure first..Ok, we only have fourteen minutes left..Ok, I have a Helicopter and a lion statue.Wow.Alright, well we got our first thing, we just need two more..I draw three.Ok, Crimson Forest, Cliffs of Abandon, Whispering Garden..Right..Oh we're gonna need to shore that up..Uh it's my turn next I can do that..Ok.uh, Cliffs of Abandon is here.Yeah.And Crimson Forest is gone..What else did you say? Crimson Forest.Ok go for it..Crimson Forest is gone..Yup.that one.Oh it is gone, ok.(--).Yeah.Ok.I guess, I guess if we draw a flood card for something that's already gone we just take it out of the deck right?.And discard it.or would that not happen?.I guess I'm.Wait, what was your question..It wouldn't happen. It shouldn't happen..Cause the, the treausre deck is big enough that there are more than four, but there's not more.than one.flood card in here.for each.thing..Ok.Ok.Yeah.Ok.Ok.Ok.so.would it be beneficial.for me to give anybody any cards?.Probably not..Uh.(--).Well look.I don't need this fire, right?.Mmhmm.Mmhmm, yeah, especially since we already have that..If you give me an earth.and then you give me an earth.Uh huh, yeah.we should be good.That sounds good..I think, ok.Ok.So.Oh crap, I'm gonna lose one of these. Well that's fine, he has a couple. Cause I'm gonna- I wanna see how- If.Well.if we do that I'll end up losing one of these lion things..Yeah, that's, that's fine. Cause I can give him one.I still think it's ok, cause he has, yeah yeah yeah.But we yeah we have more than four..Ok, so that's, that's action number one..Wait, wait, wait.Ok- Oh that's gonna go in the discard, ok..Uh.Ok.Mmhmm.Um.Huh, interesting.I'm going to shore up.Where- Ok.this one.One.Mmhmm.and then I should just shore up another one..Which one, this one?.Yeah, I would say so, yeah..This one?.Yeah, cause that one's a good connector..Alright.Ok.Yeah.So I will shore up this one..Ok.Fantastic..Ok.Two cards.Oh.Well look at that.(Great).Um ok so which one should I discard?.Huh that's nice..Just (--) do.That's interesting..Um.This one, right?.Can we sandbag anything?.No we can't.Well we don't.We just-.We could do the Bridge..Breaker's Bridge isn't in there, right?.Is it?.Oh right I.Yeah it is..Oh ok.So I should discard.this because she's gonna give you that..Yeah.I think.that is a good idea, yeah..Right?.Ok.Mmhmm.Alright.I'll discard that and then.(--) us three of.Ok.Uh Temple of the Moon,.Mmhmm.I need to give like each of you one of my cards..Um the Cave of.Embers.and Silver Gate.Ok.which is this one..Ok.Ok.So we can sacrifice this thing now..Yeah.Yeah we can.Yeah we can- we don't care..Like that doesn't matter anymore, yeah/.Um.Right.Ok.And potentially- ok.Alright.Now just, just so you know, because you can use flying as one of you actions, and we both have a Helicopter Lift, if you wanted to.Mmhmm.Ok.we could move you somewhere to give him the cards and then you could go somewhere else if you needed to.(--).They're already on the same spot.Yeah, yeah, yeah.Oh, never mind..which is good..Right.Yeah.Ok.So.Ok.So, I'm gonna discard this thing..And I give you this..Yeah.Ok.Great.Ok.Thank you..Ok.So.did that take one of my actions then?.Mmhmm.Yeah, that's one of your actions.Yeah.And then.So you have two..Let's see.I would.shore up the Temple of the Moon..Yeah.Just so he can get.Mmhmm.on the next turn so he can get it..Ok.Then well I guess you can shore up Silver Gate too.Mmhmm.I don't see why not..Right, but should I give this to him.on this turn?.I don't think you can. You have two actions and it takes two movements to get to him..I mean, she can- she's the Pilot. She could fly if she.I mean I can.(--).Oh that's right, I keep forgetting that..Yeah.But that does take one of your.Yeah, I think it's better to protect this one.actions..Flying takes action..Yes..Yeah flying takes.Ok.Mmhmm.I think that.Unless we used a Helicopter Lift card.we need to save.I'm not sure if you would want to..Ok.We could- Ok, we could sacrifice thing and then lift me over to the other side..I don't know if we wanna do that or not..Ok, but we need to flip this over now..I don't know what's faster..Yeah.Ok, that's fine..Ok so.Yeah.Ok.we'll flip that over, so that's the other action..Ok.Mmhmm.And then.should I just move to.Wait, wait.what?.You- Can you fly.someone else, or just yourself?.I can fly someone else with this but.Oh but you can.Oh, like we could do it for free then she could trade with him and that'll be her last action?.So what you thinking?.Um (--).But I think it would just be.I don't think it's a bad idea..better to move to him..You.Ok.Yeah, that's fine..Ok.Ok.Um.But you.you cannot move diagonal, like you're not gonna get over there in time..But she can fly there..I mean I can fly there..Oh that's right, sorry.Ok.so.Ok.OK so you're done right?.Yeah.Is that three? Ok.So I pick up two of these.Ok.Thank you..Let's see.Dunes of Deception,.Coral Palace, and Bronze Gate..Ok.Cool.One,.It takes an action to get the treasure right?.Yeah.Ok.Two.Thanks. Two.uh.I'm just gonna shore this thing up I guess.Um.He can do that diagonally..Well.Yeah, I can..Do we just want me to run back to.Fool's Landing already?.but whatever you- What's the last thing we're getting..We could either get.the wind or the chalice.I also have- Yeah, I have these three..Yeah.Right.Uh.For your last one you can give him that..I'm not on the same tile. I keep forgetting that..Yeah we're not on the same tile and we're not- yeah we're not close enough..Oh- yeah that's.Yeah.That's a thing..I keep forgetting that..I mean, again I could- If you wanted me to fly you, I could do that..Ok.Oh, ok.Oh yeah.Um.Yeah but look, even if you flew me over.and I gave you this thing, you still wouldn't have enough, yeah..You don't have four..Yeah.Yeah.So.So there's no point..It would be more beneficial if like.Wait who has- who else has the green- I do, ok.Yeah.So you should just.shore up.Ok.that's fine..the thing I guess.Ok.So now it's my turn..Alright.Alright, let's see..I- you- I know what you're gonna get..Thanks..Yeah.It has to be.I didn't get.Aw sweet.Yeah.Oh good, ok.Yeah.Aw crap.Thanks.Eight minutes.Ok.Yeah.We got two.Ok.Yeah we're gonna get.Ok.So.Damn.So where- you're right there right? So you can shore up.Yeah what makes the most sense?.Yeah.Mmhmm.Ooo yeah.two right?.Mmhmm.Um.If I put.So you could.What would be best then is if I move to here.to shore up the two with these treasures on them.Can you do this, like one move, two move, three move?.Or no.Um.so.We need to flip this over, right?.Yeah.Right, so yeah, since he's on that- so that would be flip that over, move here, and then flip those two over, right?.Which.(--) just in case I think is a good idea.Oh.Right.I think it's the most efficient thing to do..Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah..Ok.Ok.You can.you can.do that though right? Like it's not just tiles you're adjacent on?.Yeah, cause these aren't diagonal..Ok.Yeah.and then, so that's one..Two.Two.And then three.three..Ok.Ok.Alright.That one too..Ok.OK.one.Oh no.They got another Helicopter though, so that's good..ah.forgot..And nobody's on a sinking tile which is also good..Yeah..The only person that would be safe.would be you..One,.Me? Oh yeah..Yeah, cause you can go- Or if that's where- you could move diagonally. Nobody else could do that..Two.I can move diagonal, yup..Three.Ok, Temple of the Sun,.Temple of the Moon,.and Copper Gate..Yeah.Ok, so we didn't lose anything..Alright.Cool..Alright.Hooray..Alright so it's my turn..Yeah.Ok.I.So we can't.use the sandbags now, right?.Because there are cards in the deck, I think, so, yeah.We can,.we can, yes..Yeah.so.And those are free actions and like.TRUE.you have five cards..Right.so.Oh yeah.these.we don't really care about these becuase we already have the treasure..I don't think so..Yeah.Mmhmm.Right.And so the only one I can't do is Copper Gate..Ok so we could do.Which is fine..What.So do you want me to do this one?.Yeah, I guess that's good..I just feel like.you might end up with all four chalices, you know what I mean? If.Right.Maybe.I don't know, they're just free actions, you know what I mean? I feel like we might as well use them..Yeah.huh.Ok, so, so I'm gonna do that one..Ok.Well, hold on, before you.Don't we also want the.Mm.Oh never mind, we're ok, sorry.Ok.Um.Ok what do we wanna do now? Do we wanna move you to the chalice thing just in case?.I think we should.Ok.So move, move.Ok.I'm done..Oh wait, wait, wait.Hm.That's two moves, right?.We don't need, we don't need that..Yeah, that's two moves, so you'd still have one.We don't need that..We don't, but if we keep it in the pile it means.it's less likely something else will get flooded. Do you see what I'm saying?.Like if we keep this in this pile it means we won't pull something else,.like Fool's Landing for example..So you, so you're saying I should use this, or I should shore up?.No.you could just shore it up and then one, two..Right, and then that'll be three of your actions..Oh.Mmhmm.Yeah.Ok, so I'm gonna.Wait what am I doing- I'm sorry, say that again..Shore up for one and then move two.Ok.Mmhmm.Ok.Yeah.(--).Yeah.Ok cool.Ok.Alright so now I draw.Yay.Yup.Perfect.Alright.that's what I'm talking about.(--) we're gonna have to wait..Um.Oh sorry, thank you.No it doesn't, it doesn't matter..Ok.Alright well.ok.Aw crap that's the one I'm standing on..(--) I see the Copper Gate in there..Or uh the other Gate.No, Bronze Gate and Dunes of Deception..Ok.Ok.So.Yeah that was a good move shoring that one up, that would've been sunk..Yeah.So I can move right here.and then flip this back over..Well look, here's what I'm thinking..Yeah.Or.Oh that's true, ok.Or I can- And I can give.Or you-.or.(--) we can't sandbag it either..You should.Or I was gonna say, you can fly here.and then flip this because we're all gonna have to end up on here.Right.Ok.in order to leave..Mmhmm.But look.Oh right.how.And I- Since I'm here.I.I can get this on my next turn and we only have four minutes..Right.Ok.Ok.Ok, so I'll do that and then.Yeah.So- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.Can I give these two to him?.That's what I was wondering about.

Oh yeah.Oop.There we go.Ok.Ok.So I could move here and then fix that one..Oh cause you can move diagonally right?.Mhmm.Yeah.So that's one move.Wait does.What.I don't know if there's.is that adjacent?.take backs in this game.Why?.What no she can move diagonally that doesn't matter.Oh is that- does that mean that you're adjacent to this now?.yeah.Ok got it.Well adjacent is just if you're directly on it. But she's the Explorer so her special thing is she can do.Well.Yeah.So I can do it, anything diagonally.She can kind of do anything got it.in a square.Ok so that's my first move.Then this moving, fixing this will be my second move?.Mmhmm..Mhmm.Ok.And then what else should I do?.Should I give.this.I would say.Oh no we're not on the same tile.I think it might let's see.If you move here, you're pretty close to three separate treasures.Mmhmm..Yeah that's a good idea.So that's what I think.Might as well yeah.Hmm. Yeah..Ok so I'll do that..Cause then like you can make progress towards trying to get this, the statue.There.Mmhmm..Yeah.Or whatever.And I can collect the statue by myself, oh yeah I would have to cause it's.Yeah you can.But yeah.I just have those two.Ok..So there and that, three, four, five..And then can I have.Two of those.Two oh sorry.Thanks.Oh ok, Whispering Gardens.Whispering Garden.And Iron Gate.Thank you.Hmm.Ok so I'm gonna.What I think I want to try to do is get the chalice..So four of them are already on there, so I can definitely do that..So.who's.blue?.Ok.mmm.I'm blue.You're blue.Ok let me.Shhh.I'll trade you.The- oh wait.Let me look at this real quick.Can you trade? Wait.Yeah I don't think you can trade, you can just give it to her..Yeah that's right, so.Mmm..I'm not gonna bother doing that.Ok so I'm gonna move.here.Shore that up.Mmhmm..(--).And that's all for now..Water's rise.oh.You got luck.So now we're at three.Oh no.We can't lose that guy.Yeah.That would stink.Well we can but.it'd be better not to..Hmm.And I guess because this is getting discarded.You don't have to discard another one right? Cause you're past five?.two four- well I.have five.No that doesn't count.But the- you're right that's getting discarded anyway.Ok.But even so.Just to clarify.Like even if weren't I only have five so.Yeah.Mmm oh.I don't think, I don't think your card counts as.It does, yeah it does not.Ok.Oh look what we just.No.That's gone.Mhhf.Ok I knew that was gonna happen.Oh should've-, we should have used the Sandbag I didn't even think of it.Oh.Oh well.We're learning ummm.I.You should give me your lion right?.But I can't cause you have five already and I don't want to get rid of.Oh no.Yeah that make- yeah I get you.Um I could use a Sandbag if we're.thinking that we need.one, do I have to.You can use that an any.Do I have to be near it?.time..Oh yeah can you use that at any time?.No it's anywhere. It's any of the tiles.Oh ok.But neither of those are like important.Um.Yeah so don't use it yet.I wouldn't, yeah I'd save it.Oh true, true, ok.Yeah and they're on the edge of the game, too.Wait until this guy.goes away cause.if we lose him then we lose.Yeah.Well.so do I want to do anything actually?.yeah.Well I don't think we, well cause we only need three out of the four treasures..Yeah we don't lose automatically, but it will make it way harder to win.Oh yeah that's true too.Yeah.Well let's see so you have lion and.Crystal.The one that just went away, what was the one that went on there? It was a lion? Ok.It was lion..It was the lion.Um I'd say move like.Here, just so we're all, like we should probably try to be fairly spread out I think so we can.So move two, you think?.Just- or somewhere, yeah.I'll move two cause I have a red already so, it kind of makes sense I guess to me.Yeah sure..Um and then I'll just.do this.Oh yay another Sandbag.Oh and there's the Lion.nice!.Ok this doesn't count right? That's (--).Ok well that's good.Yeah.Don't forget you have to take three.yeah I have three.Oh we're.Oh that's.it moved up to three.Three I see.Temple of the Moon ok that one, ok Cliffs of Abandon.It's right next to it.Oh there, oh no, Iron- Iron Gate.And Iron Gate.So we lost him.That's this one.ok well it doesn't matter.Oh, ok.But that- that's ok, wait can I have the card?.Oh.Mm, yeah.sorry.Thanks.it's alright.Ok so I'm on.Temple of the Moon.So we should fix that.Mhmm.Yeah.Yeah.Definitely.And then.So that's one.And so what I think would wo-.I can.be a good idea is fly to me and give me the.Um chalice.Beacuse I'm trying to get that. And then that'll give me three out of the four.Where are you- ok.Oh that'll give you one step closer.Mmhmm..Ok.And then the Explorer can, yeah.And I can just give it to you.Awesome yeah that'll be the next turn.Ok alright.And then hop right back, if you want to stay on that tile.Yeah.Should I fix.Cities of Abandon before I fl-.Oh no wait.You can't give me the tile if you do that.Oh no I would have to fly and then give you the tile ok.Gotcha.So fly to you.Thanks.That's three ok.Mhmm.Ok so I have the lion and then the.The crystal.Move to Temple of the Sun, which is this one..Mmhmm..Crimson Forest.And Breaker's Bridge.I'm horrible at finding these.Ok.they're hard.I know.It's like upside down too.Ok so.Alright.I should come to you right?.Mmhmm. and give me the.and give you that.other chalice which means I'm gonna have to.discard one of these.Oohhh.Oh I didn't think about that.But.But then we'll definitely- but then I'll definitely get.I didn't realize that there were more.yeah yeah.the chalice next turn unless.Yeah I will definitely get it so.Ok so I'd have to do two moves so.Maybe I could.Oh you're.Should I heli-.Oh that's not me.Ah should I Helicopter Lift you? Oh.Yeah you're right there.I'm right here.No she's right there.Oh never mind.Whew I got nervous.Ok one.And then give you that.Two so which one do you guys think I should.That's two.I think you should discard the.Crystal.This? The red one?.The purple?.Well actually I don't know.Well let's see here.I have one.That we have three of each um currently.yeah.yeah it doesn't.totally mat- oh no well we have four, yeah.Uh I'll discard this because I'll.No we have four, we have.Oh we do have four, ok.we have four, yeah get rid of that one..We have four so get rid of the red one yeah..yeah definitely.Uh over there.op sorry.ok so that was one move for me.It's ok.um.One move and then you traded so that's two actions.Oh two so two.Oh so two moves.then you.and then.So you can go right back if you want or you can fix.maybe just.Yeah let's fix this guy.fix one..cause that would, if we lose that, that would be a bridge between a bunch of them.Mm..Mm..Ok.can I have two.of those cards?.mmhmm.Ugh.Not Water's Rise oh!.Yeah I did.mmm.Ok so.move it up.And then I have to take three still.Mmm.Mmm.Ok Temple of the Moon.Mmhmm.Cliffs of Abandon.Oh.Mmm.And Breakers Bridge.Shoot.That's such a cheery name.Ok.Yeah.Cliff of Abandon.Ok.Hmmm.So you should definitnely go get that guy.Yeah.So one.One.And then you get the treasure.and discard is two.do we.two.Oh discarding is two.discarding and getting it is.I get this.two you think?.No I think she's saying like that's the second action.No.Yeah that's like the- the second move.This is the second action.Oh got it ok yeah.Yeah.And.I can't.fix anything from here.So I'm gonna go.Mmm.I'm gonna go here..Ooo.Oh no.I realize ok so we have.Two.shoot.Of the.Crystals?.Earth.Oh yeah you should fix that before.The earth ones that are.flooded.I can't though.But you can't.Yeah but.You could with the Sandbags.I will for sure.Oh yeah.Cause he has to draw three but.I would do that now, yeah cause I have to draw three at the end of this turn.Yeah.So should I just go?.Well you can do those when it's not your turn.You can do it at any time?.Oh.The Sandbags.Oh shoot yeah I forgot about that. Um.Yeah.So action discard.So can I just.Yeah so put that there.from any point.Yeah and it doesn't count as an action.I don't have to be anywhere near it. So do this one we're saying?.Yeah.And then do the other one.Oh use both?.Use both of them.I mean if we lose those that's gonna make it.pretty difficult.TRUE.Oh yeah.is what I'm thinking.so do this.I mean if you guys think we should save it.I don't know.What do you think, it's your card.I don't know (--).It's.I, I think it's.It's like a matter of luck.How many do we have of those?.We only.Well she had two and that's it.Mmm, so should we save it for Fool's Landing?.I mean like total in deck.Oh I don't know.Oh yeah that's actually wise.Beacuse then you might be able to fly over and save it if you.Yeah that's true.So maybe save it.Ok yeah.Yeah so keep it.Ok.Ok so you still have to do your third action.So your.Ooo.or you don't have to.or yeah.I don't. I might not. I can't really think of anything useful..ok.Mmm I don't know maybe move to the crystal? I don't know.Cause I need to.Just stick with that..Cause- since there's no use for Coral Palace anymore.mmhmm, except as a bridge.other than it being a br- yeah.That's too bad I can't give this to you or trade it.I feel like you.you could s- go to Cave of Shadows and then if Breaker's is still there grab it on the next turn.Yeah.That's true.And then you'd be that one closer to the.Ok.Yeah that's true, it's unlikley but we'll hope.Ok.Um.Ok so pick your two treasure cards.oh yeah.So I got a lift ooh and another crystal.Oh nice ok..Oh that's good..Mmhmm..Lost Lagoon.gone.Hmm it was already lost.Temple of the Sun, gone..Man.this happens what.Ah the wrong one.Ohhh.Oh.Crimson Forest, oh gone well that one didn't matter.Ah.gone.Ok.Ok so lesson learned use the Sandbag's um alright.You should probably give me.yeah.Your lions.right?.do you want to get rid of what you already have though?.because then.well I can get rid of this guy.yeah cause we already have the chalice.oh true.And then she and I are on the same thing and then she can give me hers..So I'll give you one Lion.yeah.Ok.So I can get rid of the chalice..Um wait can I give multiple card as my one action?.You- no one action is giving one card, but you can- you have three total actions so.Ah.It says treasure cards.You can yeah you can give it to anyone..Ok so you just used one action..Ok so that's not part of my special um..So where are you?.Maybe I move closer to- or I'm already on the red and I'm not gonna get the Lions.Um I don't think I can really do anything else at this point that's useful.Yeah you might just want to stop..yeah.Also.We don't want to run out of the time..Yeah.Select these oh great I have two more reds..Oh good.Awesome.Ok.Mmm.Mmm.Let's see Tidal Palace.Silver Gate.Mmhmm and Copper Gate.This one.Ok.ok.So I would need to give you a Lion. Are you text to a lion?.You can get.We're around the same thing right? Cause you're blue?.Ok.Yeah so you should give me.But you could get to the Lion on the next turn.mmhmm.Yeah.Ok you should give me that..Oh but you have to discard something.But then you have to.But that's ok cause he's got two..And you've got one and I've got one..Yeah well that'll work out..TRUE.Ok so we have three. Ok so I'll give you that.For one..Move..And then.And the save one I'd say..Yeah I was gonna say fix that one..Should I give you something?.If you have three.Um.Should I give you one of the purple?.Cause he's kind of near there if we saved this you could get to it.I would, I would fix this.Because then, cause he can't- he can't even get to it unless you save it.Yeah actually cause that's the bridge- cause then he won't be able.Yeah I'd say fix that..Ah ok..That's more important.That's your second action?.Ok.Ok mhmm..Yeah so that's your second action.And that's two.And now.Cause if I draw two cards I have to discard one of them.You can just move..Oh you're right..Because I'd have six..Yeah.So maybe I should give you this?.Yeah actually that's a good idea.You can't though. You're already passed that point..Oh no but you can't yeah cause you're on the same.Oh I'm not.I keep on forgetting who's.Ok you're green.Oh well so you don't really need that ok so then.Well.Yeah I forgot you had those two Helicopter Lifts.Just.Yeah should I just.Well should I use the Heli.What do the Helicopter Lifts do?.You can move anyone anywhere..Yeah I can move anyone to anything..Do we want to move him closer to where purple?.The Engineer or yeah the Engineer closer to where purple is?.I don't know do want me to move you on to purple?.I don't know.Um yeah that's actually a pretty decent..Actually that's not a bad idea.That's actually a good idea. That's what I would do.Move you to purple? I could do that any time..But.if you want to do that now.Oh maybe.save it.Yeah do it now before you.draw your cards.Ok.And then you can keep those cards.Or should I draw the cards before and then see what.the cards say?.Ah that's true.Yeah actually do that because when you discard an action card you have to like use it at the same time, so that yeah that's a really great idea.Oh that's true. Ok do that, yeah, yeah..And then.Actually yeah that's true do that.Can I do that?.Wait when you discard you have to use it?.Like if you discard the Helicopter Lift, you don't just like throw it away, you use it and throw it away.Oh.So yeah definitely, draw two.Ok.So then.Let's see where- what it is.So I got two.Oh you got a Lion ok.things.Ok.So now you're at s.We don't need this purple because.We already have enough.On.Or-.Yeah we have enough.We don't need the lion.Oh we do have a lot of Lion ok.And she already has all four lions so get rid of that..Ah ok so then let's get rid of the lion.And I have one lion so I can give that to her.yeah.So get rid of that.Yeah there you go and you can save your Helicopter Lift.Ok.Or if you want use it.Alright.So Bronze Gate which I think we just fl-.Mmm.Oh no there's alot of Gates. Ok Cave of Shadows.and.Dunes of Deception.Oh ok..It's ok I can- we can fly ourselves off of it I can- I can fly you myself.Bummer.Ok my turn.So I should probably fix that one..Um.And then go to that one..No cause you cause you have to use.You need three moves like you have to.get.you have.Oh you're right, you're right ok..You have to travel twice to get there and then discard.Yeah get the treasure cause I'll fix these on my turn so.So I'll go.Ok.So I'll go here.And then this is two.And then I get this guy.And.That's actually only two actions so.No that was three cause she had to.Um move.She can go diagonal.two.Oh you went diagonally.Yeah.Yeah.Oh I didn't know you went diagonally.I forgot you could do that.And then.Oh I wish I could give this to you.So didn't we save you?.Yeah so then you can save that tile again..We could save that?.Oh yeah then I could do that, that's a good idea.Cause you can save diagonally as well?.Might as well yeah..Yeah.Cause I can save diagonally.Ok cool then can I have two of those?.Oh man.Ok.I keep forgetting you can do that. It's so cool..I know I forget she can go diagonally..Jealous of your talents..And then three.Alright.Oh man.I know I'm worried..I know.Cave of Embers.That doesn't sound familiar so that's good..Yeah.Howling Garden.Ok.And Misty Marsh.Ok so we already have the lion, so I don't care if that sinks.Ok so I'll.It's not bad.Ok.Yeah.We already have the chalice so I don't care if that sinks or that, although that would suck cause that's a bridge..Mmhm.Ok.Yeah so let's try to save that one.yeah.So you need the one that she's on?.The one that Messenger.yeah the Messenger's on and then.The.The one that you're on.Mhmm.Um.I just realized we should have given.oh no nevermmind.But I couldn't cause we weren't on the same thing.Yeah that's true. I keep for-, I keep remembering that that's my talent and then I was like never mind.I know it's so confusing.Ok so I need to get here..You're the red one? You should save this one and then go up, up..Yeah.Do you-.That's what I was thinking.Yeah cause it doesn't matter if we lose that..Yeah.Do you want ok, yeah I mean you can do that but I could fly you there if you, oh you have a helicopter-ok so we have three Helicopter lifts.So.Definitely.Save that up.Save that one.Mhmm..That's one, two, three.two, three I don't have a Heli- Oh I do, ok never mind.Yeah.Well that's good cause we need at least one to get off so.Yeah ok.And we have- We all have to make it to Fool's Landing right?.So I have these two.No, you don't have any, that's unfortunate..Yeah.You should use your Helicopter Lift to go to him and then give him those..With your remaining actions, yeah that's a good idea..Yeah.Ooo ok.Cause then I can have.I can Helicopter Lift both of us back here..And then on your turn..Yeah.And then everybody else just has to.make it.Ok and then should we just wait for her to collect the Cave of.yeah.No cause I'll- we'll have three. You need three of the four so.Embers.No cause we only need three.Oh right, right right. Ok so.Ok..Yeah that sounds like a good plan. Oh thanks yeah.Ok should I- should I go there now?.So then go?.You're welcome..Oh, and we already have three.And then your flood cards..two, three, yeah.Oh I keep.forgetting that that card doesn't get.What am I losing, Coral palace.Observatory, over there and Watchtower.Good.Awesome ok.The Water Rise's Card.Ok cool.I'm gonna save this one. Um should I move this way or this way? We already have the cup.Oh man.Yeah good call.Try to get towards Fool's Landing cause if this goes the way we're planning, I'll get this like in the next turn.Mmhmm..Mmmm..And we all need to be on here to win so.We already have the lion so I don't care about.Yeah.Giving that away so I'm just gonna move in a straight path then.Yeah sure.No but you can't do two at the same time, so this is your first action.Oh I can't.And then moving is my second and then.So then.move, move second.third right?.yeah.Right, you're right.So I shouldn't save this one you think?.No there's no point.No cause we don't, we don't need it.Oh.Well I already have the chalice.Oh yeah and if we're- none of us are in that area then it's ok if it leaves.And all of us have a path to here. Ok good. Alright, got it. Alright.Yeah, yeah yeah..Oh awesome, so I got my own red but then I'll give away this..Yeah.Um yeah..Just in case yeah.And.So I think we have to shuffle now.And continue drawing because this ran out.Oh.You may only have five cards in your hand.That too.Oh so you have to get rid of one of those. Get rid of the chalice.Oh oh, oh yeah.Yeah.Oh you do have ok..Oof I didn't even count the Sandbag.So.So we shuffle all of them?.ta.I don't remember what it said. I think so though.Mhmm.Water Rise's cards.(--).Um.Um.If.you draw a.Immediately shuffle and stack the cards to draw yup.So shuffle all of them you think?.Ok yes.No, no no just those ones.Just these, just just these, yep. That I already- yeah..So save, these are the two that I already have.so save the ones that are in your hands.yeah.I'll just do these while you do that.Ok sure.Oo yeah Flood card.So Fool's Landing is a priority to save I think.Yeah.Mhmm, yeah cause we lose if it sinks.You should use your Sandbag now to save it..Well no, cause there's only one of each, so it's not gonna sink.Oh ok.And the observatory.Observatory which is.Observatory.is.gone so I move to here..Well perfect. That's where you're goin' anyway..yeah good idea..Ooo Fools' Landing is flooded?.Oop.Ok but it just got flooded..Mmhmm.Yeah.Ok so I'm.Let's see what.What was I gonna do?.Oh actually yeah if she gets what- you're right yeah, I keep forgetting.But careful, cause if she draws Water's Rise they do that, so I would use a Sandbag to save that right now..Definitely.Right now or- what am I thinking.No that goes there and then that's saved.K, got it.Ok cool. Phew.Right good point..Nice.Cause that's definitely what's gonna happen.Mmhmm.Ok so then you were gonna use your Helicopter thing.to fly to here.to fly to here to give him that.right.Yeah.Ok.So that's one action right?.Mmhmm..Well this doesn't count as my action though. Cause it's a special action card..They don't?.That's.Oh you're right it doesn't count as an action.Ok so yeah so do that.Yeah.Maybe I should just, well I could always fly myself to the Fool's Landing if it doesn't sink..Yeah that's true.Um.Yeah so use that.And then where, where- who are you?.To just meet you all there.So I'm blue.You're.You're blue right?.I'm peach she's blue.yeah I'm blue so I'm.So.going there.So that's your move, and then this is the first action.K this is my first action.So that's one.First action.Get rid of your lion.yeah.Lion.Um.You can take it.But then you're gonna fly both of us back but I mean I can.First action.I can do that because then you still have a.Helicopter Lift if you need it.Yeah but I mean I have another action so if I.Right but the lift.If I don't need to be on this.The lift can also move other people like that aren't even like I'd- you'd move her elsewhere..Ok so then maybe.I would just end if I were you.Well shore up.yeah.I don't think you need to do anything else. yeah..Well.like.Actually yeah it doesn't matter cause we don't these.I can get these in the next one and then.But we don't need to..True or he can ok.So.We could get all four and get like bonus points or something..I mean let's say- I could- I don't know.I'll just, I'll just hang out..We have 8 minutes left.If you want you can shore up or you can just end.But there- I don't see much a point in shoring up.Ok I'll just draw two.If it'll make you feel better you can.Oh another Helicopter Lift.but also Water's Rise.ok.Yeah that Fool's Landing would've flooded..It would've, def- like 100 percent.Cause it would have been on top.Oh ok so.So we're still at three.Ok..Twilight ok Fool's Landing is back under, Watchtower.Oh so.So get.Fool's Landing.Twilight.Is out.Is that Temple of the Moon?.Watchtower's gone..Oh no..and.and.Twilight.Twilight Hollow is that..This guy.Ok.can I have those?.Ok yes.Those ones? Well Keep Fool's Landing.Oh sorry. Yeah..but those ones..Ok now its my turn.Mmhmm.So.just.go to Fool's Landing.yeah.so.one.one.two.But I have to shore it up.I have to save it.So go diagonal so go one.So why don't you go yeah go.Oh yeah.Sorry can I do- can I go backwards?.Like I didn't actually do the move okay so one.I didn't see anything in there.Two.Man you and that diagonal. Mmm.Three.And shore it up.Ok then can I have two of those cards?.There we go.Ok.Mhmm.Doesn't matter and then three of those cards.Bronze Gate.Cave of Shadows, Copper Gate, Bronze Gate.Bronze Gate is gone.Cool, now it's your turn.K so I'm gonna take.this thing.So that's one.That's one move.That's.mo- well I mean, I don't think we'll have a problem with actions..That's one move all in one.That's one move.I think we're all gonna get to it.I think you should start moving to Fool's Landing though.Well he's got the lift.Yeah he's gonna, we're gonna lift.Oh nevermind.And we're at Fool's Landing.Yeah.So we won.And we win.Yay! Right?.Seven minutes.I think we won.We're done?.No? Did we mess up?.Oh no.Ok wait, ah so I'll go and I'll get the next one?.uh.Oh no! You have to use a Helicopter Lift to lift us off..Oh that's what it is.Oh, alright.Ok so.Oh no but sh- can she do it at any time?.Oh ok cool then do it and then we won.Yeah yeah yeah, yeah so.Yeah, yeah I can, well wait let me see- does not count discard- yeah.Ok now we're done.Boom.Ok.Ok",u,b  %  sd  ad  sd  ad  sd  fc  sd  sd  qy  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  nn  fc  b  sd  qy  b

Team2401.csv,"So you have to choose three actions.Right (--) right um.I will.So remember all these cards are in here already.Wait so I can move right?.Mmhmm..I will move.And I can.Wait.That's too many.I can shore up to two cards.yeah.Oh I see in one turn..Yeah and then I moved.Ok.Um so two can you pass me two cards?.Sure.Shhh.(--).Don't you wanted to shore up.the one with the Treasure because if that sinks we won't be able to get it..Can I go back and do that?.Ah I don't know..I can do it next turn. I don't think that you're allowed to go back and.Oh ok..Oh yeah I guess it matters becuase she can.We do?.Ok..Oh no..Oh no..And don't forget to draw your.Ok, that would go back in the treasure.Flood yeah.pile right.Umm (--).So you have to draw three of those.Two.Oh yeah equal to the water level.Oh we have to shuffle first..Right.Crap.This or that.Now those yeah, that's of the six yeah.that ok.And just put it here?.yeah.Alright.There's two.What are we lookin' at?.Alright this is sunken and that's sunken as well..perfect.No it's sunken you gotta.Oh right. Yeah put you over here..like take it off and put it in there..Alright so is it your turn?.I think.Yes..So I'm gonna.Move.Here.Oh discard them.Yeah since they're gone so.Ok.Can you only shore up um things you're adjacent to or just like anything? No for her power. oh ok..Yes.Yeah.Yeah.Um.I'm not sure.So can I.Up, down, left right it doesn't say any exceptions to that so I'm assuming not.Ok.Shore up this one..You can shore up that one..wait.We're all in agreeance.Yeah.yeah.I just want to be sure cause you know we can't go back and do things.Right so that's like two right?.And then.That's two actions..You two should always be next to each other because then you can.Send cards to each other and then.I can send cards no matter what.Or she can send cards to you and then you can send cards to me and I can go anywhere on the map.I'm thinking I should move down here so that.I can at least shore up this next turn.I mean it's in the far side does it even matter?.No that's not necessary.Unless you can you can land.No these one's sorry. They dont't matter if they're shored up or not.necessary.Ok well.Yeah, as long as they're like within.then.you want me to just move with her.Fool's Landing.As long as you're next to her it doesn't matter.So where should I we move?.then that should be fine, but I mean now it doesn't really matter I think..just.Yeah I'm just sure. that's fine..have a pick.Ok cause I have to take three actions so.No you don't have to.Oh.Yeah you can take zero so.Yeah up to three actions.yeah.So these are my two.cards.And.Just two?.draw two of these.We are sinking the Lost Lagoon, so that's gone.That was that one..Lost Lagoon..Oh ok..so.Ok sink that as well as this.And.Breaker's Bridge is..Ahh.Sunken.So now it's your go.Alright.Um.So.hmm.Hmm.I'm trying to think if.I mean you might as well just fly over here and just shore it up. There's not really much.No that we don't have to shore it that one up.We don't have to shore up unecessary ones, but I was just thinking.if I could either like move you guys.with this thing.or.The two to Fool's Landing.No into um.I mean it dones't matter now because we don't have a whole bunch of.on the same tile.the treasures yeah.cards.Oh yeah so.So you're (--) it to get the treasure.so we might as well try to keep as many.things on the board.as we can so we can still move around.That's true.yeah.So that's why you want.Well this doesn't help you move anywhere.I mean.But.yeah.yeah um.Is that a treasure card right?.Huh?.It's not a treasures card?.Ah no.That one..Cause I think we can see it so.Ok.Oh wait so we can only, do we draw it first?.You dont' have to take an action if you don't.Oh yeah after.want to.um.I guess I might as well just.take two to here for when I eventually give you some of these.Ok..Yeah ok then.Two cards..yeah.so water rise, so that goes up.oh no!.This (--) for the draw pile.is it three?.yeah ok.Do those go back in the pile?.the Water rise card.Once you use them..No this just gets shuffled and put back in here..Um no.Yeah and it's just one so.The Water Rise cards though I mean.I don't think so.Really?.Yeah.Ok.So it's just like that.So it's.Yeah and then I got this. I'll give it to you evetually I guess.Yeah.Alright.Ok so I guess I'm done.No you have to draw.Three.Oh right, how many? No three right yeah. OK..Two cards.Three, three you know?.Three.So this is definitely gone now.Yeah so that's gone..can we.Put that in the thing over there.Yeah and then Whispering Garden is flooded..It's flooded?.And then.So it's.Breaker's Bridge.where is it?.um we just discarded it.We do Whispering Garden, oh you took that one out too?.You didn't? Ah whoops yeah.Which, what was the other one that.Breaker's Bridge.You drew.Breakers Bridge, yeah.Ah.And then That.But you drew three cards.Whispering garden yeah.So what was the third one?.It was.Wait what'd I do with it? was it.Cities of Abandon?.Maybe I think I mean have accidentally discarded that.So we're on a sunken tile now?.Can we move from there or can we stay there?.You don't move until it um.Yeah so whoops so this goes over there..floods.These are discarded.So if it's flooding then you don't you can still stay there..If it's sunken then yeah you can stay there..yeah.eh, ok..I mean you can also unflood it..Sure, now I can yeah..Um.Yeah..Yeah ok..So let me do that. That's one..This one (--) is one..umm.And.move shore.I Just move here for two..So that's three actions right?.I think so yeah..Yeah..Yeah..Can you give me two cards?.And you draw.Three of these..So now I.You have how many cards?.No more than.You can only have five ok. yeah I am still good I think..Ok.Ok..Um and three..Ah Temple of the Moon.Oh don't we have to shuffle that?.No not unless you get a Water Rise card..Ok..Um..Howling Garden.Ok that one..Oh yeah.And Iron Gate.Ah right there. ok..Ok..So.Um.So it's my turn now..Yeah.Mmhmm..So we need to get.this card.yeah.to her.and this one to you.And then the yellow one to me or you? Yeah..Yeah yeah.to you probably..Ok so..Umm.I can't give it until I have like until it's my.Right..Next turn right?.Ok..no.So, oh yeah so you're there..So if you moved here that's one..Oh wait you'd have to give it yeah.You also don't have to take a turn.You can take up to three turns if you just want to stay where you are..yeah.Yeah fly.So I would just.I can give you these two..Is that one turn or two?.I mean but.be- I because I would be more than five but you can give itto him definitely..though why would he need that..Oh I see.I see I can just wait for you to turn and give that to me.Yeah.Yeah.Um so.Pretty much..I mean are you at.Cause that's yours right?.That thing was is it called?.So I get three turns?.Right?.Um.One, two, three yeah, so you can move to that place.So.I think that I will move here, shore that up, and then just.Move back to where I was?.Is that ok?.Or you can.(--).I think you should move here and shore that up, so in case we need to like exchange stuff. yeah..Oh I see I didn't realize..So.Does it have to be shored?.Oh is.Isn't it already up?.Is that's not I'm-, that's not.That's not flooded..Flooded yeah.Oh that's just blue yeah ok..Yeah, no you can move to Temple um of the Sun because that's where.yeah.This treasure is.So just stay there..Or you can move to Temple of the Moon and shore it up at the same time..Would yeah.Yeah.Ok so.Or you don't even have to move there you can just.One two.Stay.Oh that would be nice to just be at the treasure place.Alright me too, ah yeah yeah..Yeah..Ah I'm having some struggles guys sorry..umm..Ok..Ok.Alright..So I draw these two..Two yeah.Another Sandbags..Another.Ok..chalice and.I draw three of these. Water's at three..Ah, Ah.We need four..Three.Yeah..We need.So let us sink Cave of Embers.Four of these cards..Right here..Ok..Copper Gate..Silver Gate.right here.And Crimson Forest..Alright.Ok..How, how many cards do you have?.One, two, three four five.crap.Oh one, two, three , four, five, six.Um.Because I'm a Messenger, I can give one of my cards away though right?.Not now maybe? I don't know..Oh as ah.Like if I draw.Two, can I just give one of those away?.What's your thing you say?.Yeah..Oh I see. Per action..Mm..All of a sudden..And we can't like undo anything right?.No..Right, no so..So just hand it off..I.I can't. it's an action. Yeah..Just discard a Sandbag right?.or you could.Oh right..No..Wouldn't that be helpful?.Oh.I think..Since we already have a Sandbag, it would be more helpful.Right, since we need we need these..Ah.And we already have three so..TRUE.So I (--) yeah.So what do you guys want to do?.I would say discard the Sandbag.Just.OK..Yeah.Yeah.Hmm..Ok so yeah that's my turn. Alright..Um..Mmhmm..You should probably.Unsink the two things that have like.Yeah.Things on them.Um so let me think.You should yes, you should unsink your own thing..So you're on one. So you can unsink that one..Yeah.Use an action to fly to the other one and then sink that one. That's three..Yeah but most we think about.What we can unsink as well as.Using my turns to like get out the cards to the right people..Like I should be giving over this and she should be giving me this gold thing..Oh..Right? so,.I well you can't give anything to me right now..Because I would go over five cards..Cause she has five..Yeah.But I could bring..Both of you here..Two?.to this place after I unflood it..Um.But I mean we are close kind of.No not really to get our card-.You can't bring both of us cause we're not on the same tile..two..Yeah.Um.They have to be on the same tile, I think..Wait we have to be on the same tile if you want to move two people..Do you? Move one or more pawns on, oh yeah ah well.yeah.Yeah so yeah.I would say just stay at your.Treasure place..And then sink whatever you can unsink..yeah.I mean eventually we're gonna get a Water's Rise card. And then we are gonna have to shuffle these and then there's a chance that we'll lose those..Oh yeah well definitely, ok. so I'll just-. that's one turn..Two Treasure things..and then umm, if I moved you here..And.I'm here because I have.Oh no..I can oh no it's me..Wait these..yeah I know but.We still.I mean everyone that has the right cards cause it won't matter where we are. So first we need to get the cards before you know being wherever right?.Right..Oh so that's one turn. Oh I forgot this was time too..Ah.We have twenty minutes. I think we'll be fine..Yeah.How manys did you just take one action?.So.Yeah so I think I should.Move.you so then you could give me.Um, the Lions and then I could give you this and then you would just move back.Lions head..But yout can't give her anything because she.Are you gonna give that? You can't give it to me yet..Oh yeah, or is she, I would just give her that. Yeah..We'd have to wait until my turn..has five cards..Yeah.She has five cards, so she'd have to discard something..Oh yeah..That would be one of my actions..Right..Yeah..Yeah and I pick more cards anyways..You sould just unsink the one that's.This?.The one that has a thing on it..Oh right..The treasure..Ok I guess would be that..Yeah..That's three..Ok..There you go..So that's one action..Um, you can't.Don't you have to be next to me?.Oh you have to draw these too..draw two, oh you haven't even done that. ok..Oh yeah..and.You need three flood cards right?.ta yeah.One, two.Three.Coral Palace.Oh here..Coral Palace..Ok so that's over there. umm..Dunes of Deception. right there..And then Silver Gate..Yes right there yeah..Yeah it's that one ok..Ok..So I have two of these. So if I give them to oh, one, two, three, four, five cards?.Mmhmm..Oh I can't give it to you now..Hmm..that's ok yeah because I could have given it to you and you could have had the treasure if you move to.Why don't you give me your.blue one..Yeah..And unsink this blue one. That's your three actions. Are you ok with that? before you do them..Wait don't you have to be next to eachother to give cards?.Oh I forget. I have to be..Really?.yeah you are right?.Yeah..I can give cards to anybody but you can't..Yeah so let's oh yeah you.Oh it has to be on the same tile Ah gosh..Yeah you have to be on the same tile yeah.Ok so..Um.I definitely.I have to discard.Right?.Somethin-.Before you draw. Do you want to draw first and then discard?.Ok.Two.Oh I can draw first.I don't know.There's nothing in the rules that says don't draw first.can you sh-.If you ever have six or more you must immediately choose and discard the extra card to the Treasure..Yeah so the.Yeah.So then we draw one..Why don't you draw both of them. it says six or more..Ok ok never mind..And then just discard whichever one..Ok well you have to.(--) that?.Still three guys um..So this gets.And so this obviously gets.To go over there..so you just need to decide between that.Oh we have to shuffle too. shuffle put them back on..What you want to discard?.Um so I've.And then so wait what are the treasures? What did you get?.I got two lion things..Ok so we have three lions, four fire and then.Yeah..Do you have one of these things? And then four of those. So that's what we're.Yeah I do so four.I have the other two..We're going four.We'd have to get on the same tiles guys..Oh wait. yeah..Um..So.So wait four of these, four of this and then three lions and three.Three lions definitely.Cups goblets whatever.Yeah.And then so we'll just pick out of those two. (--) which we go for..So which one is the one that we have four of all together? This one?.So since we don't.Um.Is this the only one? This one and that one..Yeah that one and this one..this, Yeah this one, this one..So we have to pick..And this one?.So.No we don't have this one. I can.No.So disgard either that one or the lion one..That's three. So which one is.One, two, three..Better for us?.Can I discard more than.Two? I wouldn't want to do that actually..Good..If I like discard it would it go back in the pile?.No I think it goes in the discarded.Treasure card..Ok.So it's not as easy as just like giving you card um.So I'll just discard this for now I guess..Ok..And then you have to draw three of these..Oh wait let me put the thing back on first..Wait, did I make a move?.Yeah..I'm not where were you? Oh there..I didn't make, yeah I didn't move..No you didn't do any moves..You.Oh ord-.Oh we had to do in order..In order so you've you already done.Oh really?.Yeah I think so..Ok..though I didn't want to move anyways or I could have..Could have unsunck those things..Yeah..Ah.ok.We have to draw..three.I did that..You drew three of these?.Yeah..Already?.Yeah.Oh ok oh crap.what was (--).Wait didn't I?.I don't think so.Can I use this at any time? Does this it has to be my turn?.It has to be your turn and it has to be before you draw those..alright.I see.Yeah.Oh before she does ok this is gone.Ok.Um Whispering Garden.Is gone..or flooded..Copper Gate.Is gone.Ok.What I forget?.Ok..Ok so.What can we.So it's my turn so I'm not.Wait, wait ,wait draw flood cards equal to the water level yeah.You're over there.Yeah I don't have fancy powers like I can't move people. umm.Well you should definintely use that Sandbag.Right..So I'm thinking that I should move one, two right?.For this and this.Well my third action should be to unshore this and then I use my Sandbag which doesn't count as an action to unshore this?.That can unshore two, the Sandbag. Oh it's just one?.No it's one..It's just one..Yeah..Yeah.and can you also.unshore, oh no that's you, that's your thing right?.So.I mean we have like fifteen minutes..Yeah..Ok..oh.So you should not.unshore this and you should just use that two.Cause we're not going after these. These are all just gonna be discards anyway..What?.So.Should you move to the same tile as me or can we should we try to be on the same tile because if we're gonna exchange these anyways or we're trying to?.yeah.You two yeah you guys should try to get.you.It would be covenient to stay on the same tile..Yeah.Ok well.But she can't get to an adjacent tile.Right.Right either way I won't have three so I think I should just.Right.Unshore.I mean I can unshore both of them..isn't that one of your powers?.What's your power?.I mean I can move to like.This is shore up any one tile on the island so you don't have to be on it.Oh ok..Can shore up any one tile before it sinks.But can't be used ahhh.Oh yeah.Ok I.Since we were trying to use.this.Right..Ah actually we don't have four yet.I mean I can move here and unshore that.One, two, three. You'd have to stay here..I think.I mean I could stay here and unshore it and then I could use this to unshore it..Yeah.I.don't think that's the best thinks. we still don't have anything.We don't have to (--) one more card yet for that..So it doesn't even do us any good..Yeah I think we should.(--).She should send both of these to me.And then I can just travel you know with my power or whatever.And then I'll have three.Where would you go?.And then I can go here and then you can.Wait.And then.wouldn't you want one more? oh..And then you would give that to me.Ok so the next time.And then I would give this to you?.I couldn't give it to you yeah cause you have to be on the same.Place as I am to exchange any cards..I thought you two would just be next to eachother..Typically.two.No you have to be on the same tile.yeah.Oh ok well then you would just move there too or.Yeah I would use one action to do that..Yeah.So.(change) your move.You should give those two to me and then play this to.maybe unsink something or do something else.Wait which one are you talking about..This one.I only have one.And she has two.right.Oh so are we, are we in your.I can give, I can give them to him.So I know.Yeah.Ok.So giving two cards, is that two actions?.yeah giving the single card is one. so.Ah wait.Right, right this is two actions.I have five so I would have to discard this.Right.When it's your turn so you can't do anything now gosh.And this yeah no I would do that now. Immediately once you got more of them that.Wait when are you allowed to discard?.Yeah.Yeah.Oh because it's your turn you could pass it down.So I would have to discard these.And I would get.So is that what you want to do?.Yeah it's the only thing really to do..Ok.Um ok, so that's here and then that's.I can give you these two for two actions.Ok.Three so make.I can.Ok yeah that makes sense.Unsink.I guess this one cause this is one the one that's like in immediate.Yeah.Danger and I s-.I that's it, no I have one more action left.yeah.because I have three.No cause this counts as an action and then.one two.This doesn't count as an action.three.one two and then you just unsunk oh and that's one right? So that's three?.right so.so you're done..Any request where to move?.So either you could unsink this.Wait can you still move though?.Yes.Wasn't that three actions?.One, two this doesn't count as an action so I still have one more left..Yeah.didn't you unshore this?.That's that.Oh with the ok ok..So you can either unshore this or move closer to you know where we'll be..Because unshoring this even if it's not useful.Yeah.will still.Like.keep putting it back in the pile to stop other cards from being flooded..ok sure..So.Yeah.You can just move me later..And then I draw these two.Actually I can't cause I discarded that..Oops sorry..So.No but isn't that your power? Oh no it's not? Ok..How come?.No I just move myself yeah..So now I have three of these and um.Ok..I have to draw one, two..three cards right? yeah..Yeah..Yeah.Cave of Embers.Oh.That right there..Ah here..Coral Palace God dammit.I told you I should have sunk.I should have unsunken this one. It's gone..What's that?.Oh it's gone..Oh this..Ok..can you discard that with it?.Cliffs of Abandon..Wait.Ok yeah..this one's gone?.Cliffs of Abandon, um.Yeah.Ok.that was. Was that the only treasure card for it or no?.No there's Tidal.One.There's one more.Palace.Ok.But you cannot get to it unless you are the Pilot or unless you have one of these now, because we don't have nanything.next to it.And we can't move diagonally unless you went all the way down like but.You could.No.If you got some more there then yeah yeah..That's alot of turns..It's your go..We don't have another card for that anyways.Ok..One, two, three four I'm good.ok. We have to be on the same tile right? to exchange cards? ok..Mmhmm..So that's one..But she can't give anything to you because it's.It's.Not her turn..Yeah.Not yet..yeah so I would yeah.Right..That's fine she'll just discard the lions and then I'll give these to you that's..That's three turns..I see.Ok..Ok..You're giving oh you're giving that to me too?.Yup.So that because you're on that so next turn you can.grab a treasure.And you can give him one of those..I can discard..I have to discard these two.Yep.right.So now it's my turn or have you.picked the flooding?.oh.one, two.the flooded cards or whatever?.that as well.cards and then.ah just two yeah.sorry I.can't count.Ok so we have four of these now.we have.five actually.And five, well we'll discard one.and would you like three of these guys?.Ok.I guess so, yeah wait.Ah no choice.Ah ok never mind. I don't know what I'm thinking..Yeah..Ok um Howling Garden. That's that one..no that's (--).Wait whispering garden..Which one, that's whispering here?.Oh, Whispering whoops. Alright..Howling garden there..Crimson Forest..Oh, oh God..I know..Ok..that one.And Temple of the Moon, that's where she is on. Yeah..Ok can you stay on a flooded um..Yeah.yup.Place ok..It doesn't mean anything except that if it gets flooded again it's gone..Ok so..have five.So.you should grab a treasure because you have four.Yeah.So go ahead and.Sure true.Discard that.Give me your four and.And grab a treasure.So I beleive that's one action.Is that one turn? Yeah..Grab oh grab a new treasure..Yeah..So we put these in the discard pile?.yeah yeah yeah um.um.And then.And move to figurine in front of you. Oh yeah ok..Give him one yeah..So now you have four..Ok..Um and do.And you have another action if you want..I could shore things..Right..Sure might as well..Yeah.Is that one of my powers anywhere?.Can you shore this up?.Is it.anywhere or just adjacent?.Ah.up.to.up to two tiles.Anywhere or only adjacent?.Or adjacent..Oh.Didn't say.It doesn't say.On your power card it doesn't say?.So I guess.Yeah.Shore up two tiles for one action.What's it say on the opposite side?.Wait a second.shore up.On or adjacent tiles..Oh it has to be adjacent..Ok..So I'll just.I guess.Mmm.Just do one..There's no point in moving..Right?.Um right..And then you only have one action. You might as well just shore it up just.Yeah there's nothing else..put the cards back in the deck..Ok.So can you give me two..Ok..Ok..Ok and then.yeah.Bronze Gate.Ok so we've basically won then..have we?.Yeah cause she'll just shore things up her turn..Dunes of Deception.Then I'll capture this and she can send me that and I'll capture it again and then we'll just keep shoring things up and leave with that..Ok..Um.Iron Gate..Where's Iron Gate.Oh here, so it's gone? Discard. ok..Oh it's sunk.Ok..here..Ok so it's your turn..Ok.Ok ah so you just shore things up, that's it.Well I can only shore two things up. Should I move to this?.Yeah.No you just stay there because you're gonna, you can't.Would you give her the one card?.Well no she.Beacuse she would.Just say she goes and then it's my turn right? And I go here..And then I get that.And then I fly to like, what is this? To like here.And then she'll give it all to me..Can you fly her up.To there?.Nope..Wait how are you gonna fly there?.It's my power thing ability. Yeah..Your power is to fly?.Can you take her with you like to there?.Nope, just me. She'll just send them to me..So how would we get that treasure?.umm..I mean I can give him these at any point..Yup..Oh there's three..So..So I can only shore two things right? because I only have.yeah.Two obviously..So.why don't I give you.ta don't ca- cause I already have five. so first all you do is shore things up.No because you'd have to discard.(go to you).And then you're done..which ones?.alright.shore things up and and move closer to this just cause we'll be leaving..You should probably shore.So yeah..OK.So I can shore this one..And the one and one..And then just yeah and then just move there. Misty Marsh..What I have yeah.Misty Marsh..And then I draw two cards..Yeah.Oh no.See I should have just flew there. Ah I can do it next turn..And.I still have three..Yeah.Close though.Um.So it's your go now..Ok..So.Did you pick.Oh.Alright one two..two oh sorry three.Three thanks..Misty Marsh.You were gonna flood it.Struggling over here..Temple of the sun..Ok..Tidal Palace right?.And Tidal Palace yeah.Yeah ok.So now yeah now it's my turn.

I get it..Um..No I guess I get this thing. That's two..Yes.and then you should just fly to Tidal Palace..One more.And then I fly to.Um yeah.it's ok with anyone? yeah..Yeah.Ok..Oh um we gotta shuffle these.Right.before you draw sorry.Wait do you?.Did you get a water rise?.Yeah cause.I did, I did..No we're not..You.Oh wasn't that just your turn though?.I did..What? Yeah..But he didn't draw anything to flood yet..Wait what?.Wait..He didn't draw his two cards and he didn't draw his flood cards yet..Oh..So as long as we shuffle it and turn it and put it up.before he draws.Nope.I did..Ah uh..Ah uh..Oh..That's what I was thinking I thought.So we have to back track..Can we.Back track?.I don't know..Are you sure you didn't?.I'm, I'm sure I didn't flood it..yeah.I I I remember saying though just.I remember the ones that I got. I can put them back here and just shovel..Ah.Alright..So it was Tidal's Palace..It was Temple of the Sun and what was the last one?

Team2552.csv,"You're up Engineer.mmhmm.Hmm.Do I have to take three actions?.Yeah.So.Ah, what do you think you should do first?.Maybe we should shore up.some.yeah I mean I think we should definitely use the special, special power every time no matter what..Hmm.Yeah.So give up shore up two tiles.yeah I don't.yeah it has to be those two right?.I mean you can still move on them like so she could move one and then shore up these two.yeah that's very true.But um, yeah because we don't know which cards are coming up..Now why?.Did you say I should move this?.Yeah well if you can only, you can only shore up things that are adjacent to you so you can either move first and then like shore up these two or just shore up these ones right here..ah.So can I move this way?.You can move that way but then you can only shore up one.and that one, presumably, if you're on it..Hmm.Oh ok I see what you're saying, so I can move, I can shore these two up.Yeah, yeah.Or you can shore these two up right now and then not have to move,.then do something else..Oh that's one action so she could move right after she shores up..Yeah, yeah, I mean that you can move after you shore both of them up..So it's just a matter of which ones we wanna shore up first..So we could do is- Actually you could shore up these two right now.then that's one action, and then move here.That's- And then shore up the next two. I think that might be best.And shore up the next two? Yeah, yeah, yeah do that.Uh.You agree?.I'm sorta lost. Wouldn't that be four though?.No, that's- that'd be um.No, so you can move two per, two per turn. Sorry. So that's one move right there, those two..Second move is moving on this tile, third move is these two..Because you- That's your special, you can move two- you can shore up two um.Two per one turn..Yeah.Mmhmm.So it'd be the double shore up as one move, moving is one move, and then the second double shore up is your third and final move..But I can only move two.Right?.Yeah, per one action. So one action, one action, one action, one action, one action..You can move mult- you can unshore multiple, multiple tiles per turn..Mmhmm.That's an action. So like- You're speacial is like you can.Yeah.shore up two uh tiles and that's one action, and we have three actions. That's- um we have three actions, so you can shore up these two then you can move one right here..Mmhmm.mmhmm.Mmhmm.And then you can shore up these two and that'd be three actions total..And then you'd be done your turn and then.And you can shore up an unlimited number of things per turn, per three actions.Mmhmm.But per action you can do two, but we can only do one..Mmhmm.Ok, yeah, so let me see what's happening.Ok now then I move here.Oh, yeah right there..Yeah right there, that one there.And then.You can shore up those two again.And then those two.Mmhmm.cause you can do two at a time.and that'd be all.And then now what?.So that's your third move, so then you.And then you would- Yeah and then you would stay there and then you would pick up two of these..just stay there..You're done, yeah..Uh yeah you can see it..And then.So what are they.Uh yeah and the fire.Well you got a Water's Rise. Alright so.Ooh.Alright so just hold onto the fire one, we'll notch this baby up,.shuffle these,.Now that goes over here.Shuffle these.throw that on top..Mmhmm.And then she has to draw two..Yeah, you have to draw two of those- Yeah two of them..Mmhmm.Mmhmm.Which ones?.Mm now I put these here.Alright Gold Gate.Uh.So I have to move to the Gold Gate.No- They- It gets flooded.No, no.Oh wait, wait, wait.those get flooded, so.Um.Where's Gold Gate, Gold Gate, Gold Gate?.Maybe.No here..Yeah here it is. Alright so it's, so it's gone now. Alright.No. Oh that's gone..So that gets tossed in here and then.Mmhmm.what's the next one?.Uh Phantom Rock, that gets tossed too..Oh right..Oh, that's unfortunate..Yeah.So uh, alright, so I'm up then..Mmhmm.Alright so give treasure cards- I don't uh so who has what?.We don't have yeah.I guess I'll give, I'll give her.The fire.that one.Oh yeah because she- Yeah, that's one action..So then uh what else can I do? I can move,.shore up.so I.Um.Mm.I can't shore up anything around me..Yeah.Yeah so should I just move onto her.Maybe you could just um.Yeah maybe uh move onto the same- He, he's right here..Where are you?.Yeah I'll, I'll just move this way cause I have a lion's card, that way I'll just move onto there..Oh ok, yeah.Yeah I'm just closer.Alright so now I'll take two treasures, right?.Mmhmm.Perfect.Nice.and then two yeah..Temple of the Moon,.Oh that's right here..then Breaker's Bridge..Breaker's Bridge.Ok, you're up..Alright.Um I have this.So Pilot.Well wait, wasn't that bad because now isn't it flooded?.Yeah.Yeah it's flooded but you can still stand on it..The problem is if, if the um.If we get a Water's Rise and it goes back in and then we get the same card again while it's flodded, it goes away..we get the Rise again.and then.Yeah so we need to worry about when this card comes out again.then we have to worry about if like any cities are flooded then we need to.Sandbag.Mmhmm.Sandbag or you- When it's your turn you can start shoring up..So I'm gonna save, I'm gonna save this..I think that's the best for an Engineer, you can just start shoring up a lot of places..Yeah, whatever you just shore up..Mmhmm.So I don't think you really need to.move anywhere. I mean you.I think we still, I think we might have to do- Oh take up to three actions um.Yeah I'll just move over and just yeah.Yeah yeah, might as well..Yeah.and then uh that's two.And.Then you can move anywhere so- Wait, what you'd wanna go to a uh.umm.one of these places since you have the.Yeah, I might as well.um.Yeah.You can go to- These are the only two I'm assuming..Right.Yeah, I'll do this..Oh and if.Uh um.Mmhmm.Alright, if one of the treasure- We have to make sure if one of the treasure things gets flooded that we have to shore it up immediately, or as soon as possible..Yeah, yeah, yeah..Ok.Alright so then you take two..Uh I got a Helicopter Lift and then I got this..Might as well just put one of those to the side too for when the game's over. Just so we don't use it..I can.Mmhmm.Yeah yeah.And then- Oh yeah two..Lost Lagoon.(--) Cliffs of Abandon..Oh, Cities of Abandon, yeah..Alright, so you're up..Engineer..Mmhmm.Mm that's a.Where could I go?.Move down.and.Yeah I was thinking, move down, do the sh-.Yeah, and then those two.Cause I have this card, so I'm gonna give this to- Oh wait she's gonna have.Wait, she yeah- she can.Cause I think next- I think if she draws her next two treasure cards she might get one of those fire or one of these..There's a chance for that so.Yeah.Yeah, so I mean, you might as well just give her the card..Yeah well once it my turn, I can yeah.Oh yeah it's not your turn..Alright so if I move down here.Mmhmm.That's a move..then I can shore this up.Mmhmm.And Temple of the Moon, in the same turn..You can do both, yeah..It's your special power..Well don't- But don't you get them shore up too?.Yeah, but he can only do one at a time..Yeah we get to shore up, we only, we only can do one at a time. That's the, that's the Engineer's like specialty..You could do two at a time..Oh ok, so I can do two you both can do one..Mm yeah, yeah, yeah.Yeah.Ok.And that was two, you can do.You have one more move, so you can either move onto the Cave of Shadows, Lost Lagoon, Bronze Gate, Temple of the Moon, or Dunes of Deception.But not Bronze Gate..I think you should move here because you would get closer to me actually..Yeah.Yeah sorry you could do that..Oh where are you? You're the blue..I'm right here.Oh especially since you have the red cards too..Mmhmm.So you could draw two of.Then I also have the chalices.Yeah.Yeah but you're not around it, you can't move onto that..Why not?.Now you.Because it's diagonal..because you can't move diagonal.so you can't move- you were here so you can't move here yet you have to move.Um.Wait a minute, you said I'm here.Uh.You were here, but you only had one move, you can't move diagonally, you can only move.You were.Uh huh.left, right, up and down.Mmhmm.so.That's why we moved here..Yeah, that's why you moved there..Oh ok, so I- Another time I can move here?.Mmhmm yeah, next turn yeah. Yeah.Yeah, now you can, yeah, but here's your two cards..Um.So what did I get? Uh perfect.Oo perfect. Oh wait that's six, so you need to discard one of them..Uh oh.Get rid of the Earth the stone yeah.The stone.This one, yeah..yeah Get rid of the the stone. is it go here? I think yeah it goes-.Yeah.And then.two.of these.So now I have to put Whispering Garden back.um where it was..Whispering Garden.Yeah.What's the other one?.Eh Iron Gate.Ok.And those go over here..And here.No Whispering Garden we have to- Should I sandbag that right now?.Oh I'm next to it so.No, not yet.I don't- I think we can- we can use that anytime.so I think once we get like uh.Alright so should I just undo it right now? Just.Oh yeah you can do that, yeah do that.So that's my first move now my second tre- treasure card..Uh I don't have any.You can also do this if you want to.Yeah.That's two..And no one else has these ones so there's no real, no real point.No I- No yeah. You can move somewhere if you want..Us.I'm gonna move back on that. Might as well.Ok.Alright.so two of these..(--) yeah water's rise.Three.Yeah.Three?, oh yeah.Whispering Garden again, so flip me over, if you don't mind..Oh that was good..Uh Breaker's Bridge.next to her. Uh Engineer..Oh right.It's Engineer and Iron Gate's done with..Oh man.Oh.Ok yeah, mmhmm.OK yup.Alright.um.So you're here.I could.go over here, give her.a chalice.and then she would have to get rid of one of the fires.the fire um.treasure.if we wanna do that..Now how come.And then she could- and then on her next turn she can go here and then take a- get the treasure, you know..Get it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah..But.why can you go from here to here?.Cause he's the Pilot..Because I'm a Pilot, I can uh move anywhere..You can fly anywhere. Oh ok.Yeah.You can- (--) One move.Yeah one move, yeah once..But you can't take any more right?.No I can't take it- Only this is the uh.Ok, ok, ok, ok, ok.So you might as well yeah, go there, give that to her..Mmhmm.And then uh.And then Breaker's Bridge.Mmhmm.yeah.yeah and then.Um yeah might as well..I mean, yeah uh.That's three.Yup.Two of those.Um.Yeah,..I guess.Uh Temple of the Moon,.uh Cliffs of Abandon,.and Lost Lagoon is over there..You're up Engineer..So now I can move down here?.Yeah you can move down there..Yeah.And then.Cash in those four..You can.Those four chalices over there. And we can take this..Yeah I think so, yeah.So this is ours..So we'll discard those.Mmhmm.Um.Now is what- (--).Does that count as a turn though?.Um.Yup, capture a treasure, yup..Ok, so that was two..So, that's two turns right there..So.Back to Cave of Shadows so she can.Well wait a minute, wait a minute,.I.So you moved. You moved down to Coral Palace..Yeah but I didn't shore up two tiles..You don't have to shore up anything..I mean you don't have to.Why?.Because we wanna get the treasure..Yeah our main mission is to get the treasure and.Yeah.to get three of the- at least three of the treasures and then we're trying to fly back home..So it's more important to get that treasure than to shore up those two things..For right now, cause we're gonna need to do that later..Yeah.So you moved as one move,.Mmhmm.got the treasure as your second move,.now your third move.could either move to one of those three or to that one, that way you can shore up either one of them next time..Ok.So you can't shore up anything right now since you're not adjacent to any sunken- So your only choice is to move somewhere..Mmhmm.Mmhmm.We could, uh I mean I don't think we have to, but we could move this. And then she could just like shore up.with two of them. But I don't think.Yeah, oh yeah, to Breaker's Bridge..Might now have to worry about them.Mmhmm.But why would you use that now, the Helicopter?.The.I mean.That way, that way you would be able to shore up these two and that way the Temple of the Moon wouldn't get lost.Yeah, is that popped up actually? The Temple, oh.Yeah it's.it's still in, it's right there..Ok.So that's, that'd probably be- that's a good move actually. But make sure we don't use.the second Helicopter..Yeah.because- Or we could wait for this- the thing to pop up and then right away just use the sandbags..Oh yeah we have a sand bag too..Yeah.so she could just move up and then just- we can save our Helicopter Lifts..But then if she moves up she can only do one of those, as opposed to.Right,.that's true..So what do we want to do? Get the two now and.Yeah, I think- Yeah we can do that..bust it out..Yeah.Sweet,.do you mind if.Yeah do you, do you wanna do that? Do you know what- We were trying to use a Helicopter Lift so you get here right away.and that doesn't take an action, so you still have one more action.and then we can shore up these two..Mmhmm.Mmhmm.So then we don't have to worry about them disappearing..alright.Ok, so now I'm going back here and then I'm gonna put these.Alright.so discard the Helicopter, so now you're there,.Mmhmm.because he used that for you..Mmhmm, those two. Cause that's your special power, (to open) two..Like this?.Yeah.Ok.Ok.So now.you get two of these.and three of these..That was four..What? Yeah.Mm, yeah.So now Copper Gate,.Crimson Forest, and I have to turn those over..Which ones?.Coral Palace- Or no, Copper Gate,.Oh right here, I got it..Crimson Forest,.Mmhmm.and Temple of the Sun..Temple of the Sun, ok..Oh, I have to sandbag that one soon..Yeah.OK, so my turn..So.I shouldn't- I should give you this treasure card right?.I'm- We can't- Oh you can. Oh yeah you can..That's my power, so here, take that..One.So then, I'm- I flip him.(--).Yeah, that's probably the best idea..Flip Whispering Garden, (--).(--).You- Or you can in- You could flip.I can flip- Yeah I mean.this one..I think that's the only thing you can do actually..I don't- I don't wanna move..Yeah, that's it, alright..Oh man..And we only have eighteen minutes..Yeah.What is that?.Aw man- Oh.Are we allowed to-.Can we sandbag it?.Yeah- Oh yeah.Can we- Is that allowed? Can we like sandbag before um.Uh.Mm (--).like can we use it (--).Aw.Ok.No. Alright.Good call, thank you..Ah Copper Gate,.let's see, Copper Gate..Oh is-.Oh man.It's devestating..Yeah.Temple of the Moon ooo, we gotta shore that, shore that..Yeah, we need that- Oh, yeah we need that..Don't whatever we do, can't lose it..Yeah.That was mine, so you're up..Um did you.pick up these two?.Oh ok.Yeah.That and the Rising Water..Um.So.I mean I could give this.To me.Yeah.Yeah give that to me..Cause then she can give that to me and I can immediately cash out on that..Yeah but can I.Don't, don't I have to fly over there to give it to you?.Or is that.Oh yeah.yeah you would have to..Yeah.So you could fly, then give it to me, that's two turns..Mmhmm.And then you could- Could you fly back?.I meand I could fly back here, yeah.The problem is like if she has the other one, but she's pretty far away from you, she would have to take- Unless she.Oh yeah it's true..You could-.she's not on the.She's not close to that either though..Mmhmm.Could we Helicopter- Oh we already used the Helicopter. No.Yeah.If I meet her in the middle maybe?.Yeah, maybe..So I think.what I should do is.fly over here,.Fly, give.give it to you-.That's two and then maybe.go down, or something. Or fly somewhere else..Or fly back.Yeah and then maybe on your turn you could um.mm.I have.So well, she would have to move- She could.Oh wait, she could move here and then upshore, upshore that.Double, yeah.And then move one more..And then move one more. Yeah that might.And then I would meet her at Misty Marsh and I.But wouldn't I have to.turn this one over?.Hm?.If I move up.won't I have to flood that?.No, no, no, no.No, you don't have to flood anything. You never flood unless it gets picked from that..That's the only way you get flooded something.Oh.So you like- Yeah you can flood the one on you're on top of, I'm pretty sure, and then you can do this one..Yeah, ok, so you just wanna fly, give me that, ok.Yeah, I'll do that. That's one..One,.two,.Two.And then.Uh.do you want me to.You could- I mean.But, can't I give you this one?.Yeah, you have to be- But you have to be next- on the same tile as he is..Yeah, but you have to be on the same tile..So I flew over here, gave him the card, and then I'm gonna move some.I'm the only person that can give a card without being on the same tile since I'm the Messenger..You two have to be on the same tile.Mmhmm.to give me a card..And I'm probably gonna go.You can go to the Temple of the Moon since that's what you have.That's true, yeah.Oh and then.Oh, right, right, right.Oh yeah, we would have- Ywe would have- Yeah I would have to just go down there, yeah.Oh ok.so it's just (--) Misty Marsh? Ok, thank you..So you're at- Oh you gotta pick your.Oh right.Oh nice.Oh nice another Helicopter Lift. Wait one, two, three, four- Oh wait I needa, oh wait I needa.Oh word, that's.Uh you gotta drop the sandbag man..Drop the sandbag?.I got a sandbag.Ok.Yeah the Helicopter's crucial if we wanna.Yeah.execute this plan..And- Oh yeah, three..Crimson Forest, alright got it..Um, Lost Lagoon.and Breaker's Bridge. Oh man.Alright.so.you're up Engineer..So why can't I.move here.Mmhmm.and then I would be closer to here..Because you don't have the,.these three cards.But I have this card, so how come I can't give it to him?.Because you're not on the same tile..Because you need to- You have to be, you have to be on the same tile..Oh, so I gotta go all the way up here..Yeah.so I was think-.So we could Helicopter you..Yeah that might be a good choice..But we- Alright.And then we immediatley cash in.on that.Oh wait.But then we would have two treasures..Oh we should- You know what we should do? So we go up here um.Yeah, that's good..Flood uh shore up..Shore up, that's two. Helicopter over here and then trade that, that's three..Give- Yeah that's three. That's perfect yeah that's what we have to do..You're uh you wanna do that?.So now.Just go up one, that's one move. Shore up those two.Move up here.Yeah.and then.These two.Yeah.Uh huh.And City- I mean or Breaker's Bridge, whichever one. But that one's closer to the middle so.Ok.And then.And then we use the Helicopter Lift.Helictoper.and then.We're on the same thing.Right here.And I give you this.Mmhmm and that's three. That's three turns.Three turns.And then you get two.Oh nice, that's perfect.Oh wow.Wow.Alright well, there you go..So now I have to do Whispering (--).or Garden.So now I sunk us didn't I?.No.No, not yet, it just flooded..We're flooded..But can't you get the thing if you're flooded..I think so, um.Can- You may catch the thing on a flooded tile. Alright, that's perfect..Ok.And Tidal Place.Huh?.Oh Tidal Palace, alright.Palace?.Yeah.So, I'm gonna cash it on the, on the.Mmhmm.What, what's this dude, the wind dude?.Mmhmm.So those go away, that's one..And then.Oh who's turn is it?.It was his turn..It's my turn still so I have two moves left..Oh ok.Oh.Oh, I did have way too many.I had four of these.Oh yeah, I had.Why don't you take four of- yes You have to get rid of this one. Yeah we would have it..Oh you just get rid of that one cause we already have that- Yeah sorry..Mmhmm.So then four, alright.Yeah.So then we have sandbags.um.so I just have to move twice or I could.You, you could.unshore.I mean shore up..This I don't think we need anymore becuase- Yeah.We don't need anymore, so might as well move.down and then.Do we have to be on.Fool's Landing to leave?.Ye.No.No, no, we just have to have this card and then we all have to be- we.Yeah, yeah, ok.probably all have to be on the same tile at the end..Hm.But, we had to have- be on the Fool's Landing to win..Becuase you don't have- You only can move um.But the Helicopter (--) only can move- If we're all on the same tile we can all move together but.if we're in different tiles we can't win, so.Ok.so uh I guess we should try and stick together if we all have to be on the same tile..Mmhmm.So um, yeah I think you should just move down.and maybe (lift) this up..Mmhmm.Yeah.Alright, Dunes of Deception.Oh.ok.Cave of Shadows,.Um.I think.we have a lot of floods..Hm?.Yeah but.It's it's fine if we have a lot of floods as long as they don't get.these treasure because- cause we have the straight path towards it..And Silver Gate.Silver Gate.Ok, none of those, none of those matter..Uh oh wait, one, two, three.because.Yeah, that's rough..If she.Oh man.Oh.got it. can- Wait if you move onto it and then you Helicopter, or.I can't Helicopter anyone, yeah, yeah.You can't, you can't Pilot with someone? Ah.I mean we could sandbag that.just to be safe..And then.You want to?.and then she just moves here and then we'll- we just have to wait two more turns..You know what I'm saying? And then we just- Because this is the last thing we need.Yeah.to (--) and then.Yeah.So we just need to get here there as soon as possible..Yeah.So sandbag it, just.Just to be safe I guess. Or.If we sandbag it now, there's, there's.no way that it can.It could come back but then it would just be.Mmhmm and then it would just be flooded. And then we'll be on top- like right next to her, yeah (--).But.Well yeah, yeah, yeah so.can I be here and then.turn these over?.Yeah but you uh- it takes moves to move that, move there..You, you.You can't- Yeah you still have to be adjacent to him.to.shore up, shore them up.So should I use this?.Is it.Huh?.I think.I thought I could move.to- I could shore up.two tiles for one action..Mmhmm.Yeah but you still have to be adajcent to them..You still have to be next to them..You have to be next to them. So these don't really- Like we don't need these anymore because we already have the, we already got the treasure.We already got that treasure..This is what we care about, that's what we need..So we need this last treasure- And you, cause you have four of them already.Mmhmm.So we wanna take this.So we're.Should I do this?.Yeah I think you should do that..But.it's your turn..And then- So.We're thinking we should move over, move here.You just wanna move there right now?.and uh move.So you're gonna fly me there?.I can't fly you there because.You're gonna fly yourself there?.No, no, you're gonna move like one, two, three right there, that.Yeah.But we're gonna be there to Helicopter out whenever you get there. So you should move there right now..Yeah, so.so you should move here, right here, and then-.Well it's your turn..Oh it's my turn?.Yeah.I just, I just, I just pulled- I just drew those..Wait wasn't it.Oh it's my turn?.Yeah I just flooded.Oh right, right, ok.Yeah, yeah, yeah, so you're up..So um.or I could.oh.I should've given you one of these and you could've moved right there and got.That's true..Mm.Yeah, I don't know..I think it's a- Oh yeah it might be faster, you're right..ok.Mm.And then she can just go one, two, three.Mm right.So.just hop on that tile, yeah, hop, just get on that tile yeah..And then yeah, oh right, yeah, that was a bad- yeah whatever..Well I mean you, we can still do it..That's true..And that way, that way she can move there..Mmhmm.And then she'll- I, I'll be set.whenever I.Well, well, you're, you're turn's already gone so you can't give me that card, unless we trade..Yeah but I mean after her turn I could just give you, give you the card..Actually, can we trade this.for that, that thing.right now?.Mm.What do you mean?.Oh wait, sorry, sorry, so um.So.I'm saying you move there.Ok.One, two.But wait, don't, I mean, don't do it yet. You know- One, two.Or one.Yeah.You move there and then unshore something or shore up something..Mmhmm.Oh, yeah.She plays, she plays her- She moves there.Ok, I, I get what you're saying.I move, I move there or whatever, give you this thing, you cash in on that.Yeah yeah.we Helicopter outta here, we win..Yeah, yeah, we win. Alright.Alright so.get there..Well, that's- I'll use one right there. And then, that's one..And then shore something up,.or whatever..Two.So then.I can do two, cause I Helicoptered there so.Oh ok ok.And then I could just do this (--).Yeah whatever..So then.you just move there,.that's all you need to do..And then I needa-.Wait hold on well I need to.Oh we still need to do all that nonsense..Yeah.Uh I- One, two, three, four, five, six. I need- I'll just get rid of this..This is what could mess us up..Oh right here..And then- Oh yeah, three..Uh Bronze Gate,.uh Howling Garden is gone.Oh wait that's not Howling Garden.Howling Garden.and then Cave of Embers,.which we don't need..So then.so then you move.to the Temple of the Moon..Yeah yeah.you move over here..Yeah, that's all I need to do..So there's that.And then she needs to do that..And then.you need to do this..But now.And then you have to get-.Well what are those two?.Can I see those two cards?.Hm?.What?.Well one's a Helicopter Lift and other one's a Water Rise.You.you can um.So just put, so you got the Hel-.Get rid of one of the fires, sh- we can just- Uh.Well you just- She has five, that's fine..That's just a- Oh yeah you have five. Oh wait you don't have to get rid of anything- Oh becuase of the flood card, right.So what am I getting rid of?.You don't have to get rid of anything.You don't.Cause the water- This gets played immediately,.Ok.you know?.mmhmm..And then so-.So I have to rise the water.Yeah rise the water.Is it four?.And then I already picked those, so.Is it four or three? Oh it's still three..Is it- It's still three..Ok, that's still get.I think we still got this because we still have this card right here..Yeah, we still got this, yeah.Two, three.Crimson Forest,.Yeah um that's gone..Can I.Dunes of Deceit.Deception, rather..Yeah, that's gone..And Cave of Shadows..Alright.Alright so then.nice..I'm.Alright.give you this.Right.I move one.I move two.Mmhmm and then you're good..I flip something.One, two, three, four, five (--) get rid of it..Oh wait can we have five cards?.Yeah, you can have.Oh five, right- Oh six right yeah..But, but six, yeah, yeah. So I'll just flip that for fun..Mmhmm.So then cash in on that.Oh I gotta do this..Mmhmm.(--).Three.Alright Cliffs of Abandon,.Right here.uh Whispering Garden.(--) is gone, Breaker's Bridge..Whispering Garden.I love it..excellent.So then, yeah.Cash in.And then my turn yeah cash this in.and then.can we just Helicopter Lift outta here?.Or I could just- To be safe, to be safe I could Helicopter here and then she can Helicopter.Well let me look at the.Oh ok.Discard heli-. Yeah, discard it..Mm.And we're, we're done..Or we could.have- use a Helicopter Lift right here.Wait, hold on.Then one, one player must discard a Helicopter Lift.(--) to fly your team off the Foridden Island.for the win..Oh so we have to be, we have to be in Fool's Landing I guess..Oh do we?.I, I could use the Helicopter Lift.Mmhmm.Ok.here and she can use her Helicopter Lift and then it just (--). Yeah.Yeah, might as well do it. Yeah, yeah, do it..And then Hel- And then you use- you can use that anytime and then we.Oh to the Fool's Landing tile, I should've read that, yeah..Oh wait.Mm.And then we use the Helicopter Lift.Alright, yeah..Well you still have to do this then.For what?.Isn't that where we wanna be?.No, but you- No she doens't have to use it- It doens't have to be her turn doesn't it?.Yeah, yeah, you're right, yeah..But then yeah.So then we use it for that and then we.And then discard.we win.",u,"sd  b  b  qy  b  %  qw  sd  %  sv  b  b  sd  sd  qy  sd  aa  sd  qw  qy  sd  b  qy  sd  sd  b  sd

Team2601.csv,"Ok so, I go first then..K..Um.So I think we should like.uh.Figure out which tile's the most important to definitely maintain and not be sunk..Yeah..Yeah..Ah then the others, so like for example, this one I think can be ok but we have to keep in mind that we don't have.Yeah I don't want to get stranded too, so we should probably take care of this area..Yeah. I think.Yeah so we've (--) got them.I think we should maximize saving bascially the board and then the cards will just kind of come and then we can get close to eachother when we need to sort of.And then you gotta keep in mind though that each time we keep playing it draws a flood so it's going to get more and more so we have to be efficient with everything as well.Yeah..Ok um.Mmm.So.I guess I'll use my first action to shore up both these two cause they're just right next to me.And I can use my thing more than once right?.Um yes (name$$$) you can do, yeah so you can do two and then you can move and do two if you wanted to.Ok.So these are adjacent so I might as well do these two.Then I can.move here.Ok.As my second action and then I can get these two also.Ok so it'd be three actions ok.And that's all three and then I get two treasure cards.You get a Water's Rise..Ok Water's rise and then I got the Chalice..umm so.This goes in the discard right? And then.Yeah.(--) once.We have to shuffle all these and put them on top then?.Ok.Yeah so.I do.I'm shuffling incorrectly.Put 'em on top.and we draw two..Alright Gold Gate and Lost Lagoon..Alright so Gold Gate is then.get 'em.sunk.that's sucks.and then that takes with the card itself so Gold gate.Yup and what was that Lost Lagoon?.Yeah.oh it's over here again.Ok.Ok cool alright so now we defintely gotta make sure we don't.So it's flooded.No never mind, I thought that was a treasure card, never mind..Ok so now it's my turn?.Ok..Um.Yeah.Yup alright so three actions so.um.let me see here.so you're at Whispering Garden, you're at Fool'sLanding, you have one chalice, you don't.that count as an action or I can move, um.hmm..What do you guys think I should do?.I think.Huh.You could move, I don't think giving a card at this point would necessarily help because if you give one to me because I can only hold five you know what I mean then I'm I already got two of these..right true so you have one (--).So if you.can move twice it would be two actions? And then you could.Yeah.Shore up Lost Lagoon maybe?.yeah and then you'll still be next to me and I could give you this.Ok and you're able to.Or I could fly you guys over, but I don't know if I want to use that..So you're able to give me a treasure card if it's on the same, if we're on the same tile. Ok..Yeah whenever it comes back to my turn.Ok so you guys want me to save Lost Lagoon? Is that the most important thing to you?.Cause I would argue that Lost Lagoon is not that important..Um because.It's not necessary for us to really.Yeah it's definitely true. Do you think moving to the center of the map so maybe you have more accessibility to other places would be better?.Yeah I think that'd be good cause then I can we'd have better opportunity for us you can move anywhere you want, but for us like to flip to make sure we shore up cards um as it comes, so I'll probably move um.I'll move twice and I'll move to Phanthom Rock cause that doesn't really matter that much. Is that are those the only two flooded cards that we have?.Yeah it looks like it.Hmm.Ok so I'll move.less.yeah not yet ok.I can move to Copper Gate.Ah twice and then um.I don't have to shore up anything. So that's all I can, I don't have to do anything else really..yeah..So I'll just do that. I'll move twice and then 'll just finish my turn. Is that ok with everyone?.Mmhmm..Yeah it's good with me..Alright. I'll do that..Two treasures..So I have ah Sandbags..So I can play at any time..And that said shore up any one tile ok. So we'll keep that and I have one of these so I'm the only with these two so far so keep that in mind. Alright, and then.Ok gotcha.Gotcha.Draw two floods.so we have Breaker's Bridge and Phanthom Rock, so Phanthom Rock is sunk..Oh no.and you take that as well.Breaker's Bridge is.right here.Ok so that's, so those two are flooded so.Alright.Alright cool.Ok ok cool your turn.right.Alright um.Let's see.I could.I could shore up those cause I could move.as one of my actions I can move wherever..Right that's.the two (--) but if those aren't.our main concern.Um.I think shoring up this, I think having the this like.out doesn't really matter and makes the game board smaller in terms of like moving places..Yeah.plus it's like if Lost Lagoon comes up it's just like.not having to worry about like losing one of the important ones kind of.Mmmhmm..So yes, you could- you could choose to move to it use a special ability you could choose to move one over and then still be able to shore it up cause it's adjacent to you. So you could have those choices..Ok.Yeah true..I think that's probably our best bet..Alright so maybe I'll do that..Yup ok.Alright..And then.Do you want to take a third action or.One two, um.No I think.(--).Yeah.Don't know what else I'd do.you are the only one with the wind so I think.You can move one more if you want like if you want to move back so you can cover like this area better but that's up to you.Um.Cause right now cause you guys are.sort of adjacent diagonally I don't know if that's if you want to cover most area or not. That's up to you..maybe I'll move back just cause (--).Ok.actions ok um.Because that.Yeah that's fine with me..Alright so now you get two cards..Alright.Ok.Two cards.So, another helicopter lift..And one of the Treasures..Ok so I have two of the fires, so I need to get the fire from you as soon as I can..Ok so you have two of them.And then.which means you guys have to be on the same tile eventually.do we mixed those back in the.oh not yet cause we didn't get a Flood right?.flood thing?.I think you s-.do you still draw even if you don't get those?.Yeah you still draw no matter what..You still draw two, but we don't shuffle them yeah. So you have two of these yeah.You don't mix it back up? Ok..you don't have to shuffle it back up..Right so Cliffs of Abandon, and Whispering Garden..Whispering Garrden's where I am..Ok.Ok.Ok.Nice, that's convenient. Ok so let's just put them right here then. Ok..Cool..Yeah..Ok so it's my turn. I should get to you so I can.Do we have to be on the same one or adjacent?.You have to be on the same one.Yeah to give you that.On the same one?.That's true yup..Ok.um.I could.and.get there but it would take me all three of my moves and then.You can keep in mind that she can fly to you at any point as well..Mmhmm..She can fly at any point to me? She doesn't have to be.Yeah any tile.Yeah she can she's ah.and not even your turn?.it has to be my turn.well it has to be her turn but it's to keep in mind you can technically move anywhere you want and she can always get to you..but.Ok.True and if I get one more card or two more else I'll still be at five so I won't have to discard anything. See that's fine. I can then.Right..Ah.I guess I can just.so.take these two as my first action.Hmmm.And fix them.Ok and keep in mind yeah so the two that you have for the fire it's- are these two right here. so you have to-.Yeah so I might as well move towards it.Yup (--).Um so.and then I'll move in towards the center cause being on the corner I don't think is the best idea.Ok.Alright.Good alright.Alright.Yup and I need two..Oh I got a fire one too that's good..Ah.Alright fire then ok and two flood.Yup.Ok we still got Temple of the Moon and Iron Gate..Temple of the Moon's there, Iron Gate's there..Mmm. Here's Iron Gate.Ok.Alright so it's my turn.Um.Look.you should definitely see a Temple of the Moon just cause it's.Ok yeah I can do that.One of the.ones we need basically.so I'll move shore up and then.then.no one needs any of my cards right now.no I don't think so. so I think you're fine staying at the top of the board..Hmm.And I have four cards. I have four cards which means that when I get the next two, I will have to discard one of these..Shore up..So I could just use this..Ah well there's no- is there really any point in using it because..Oh..No not really..I would wait till I get.use that for like once I get around here..yeah I would save that for whenever we get into a dire situation. I'd rather get rid of an idol than get rid of Sandbag card..Sure..Ok.Cause right now we can get wherever really (--).Well I would- so is there- so this is what I'm thinking. Is it cool if I.I would move here, shore up and then move.back just because I'd still have like a good.yeah that's good with me.yeah.Ok.Ok I'll do that.Alright cool.Move back, I'll get two treasures which I'll have to discard once- the water's rise..So we have to move that one up.Um.Now you gotta draw three of them after you shuffle them back in.Ok so, keep in mind that we have Temple of Moon and Iron Gate so we'd like keep in mind also which ones we draw for floods.Mmhmm..Alright..Then..Pick three.Alright so we have Temple of the Moon again..Ah Cliffs of Abandon.Ah where's that the middle so its (--) Breaker's Bridge..breaker's.bridghe here..Ok so those are..Ok.Ok so it's good that you're near by those..Alright..Engineer. Ok..Um.I'm thinking I'll.Go here..As one of my actions..I can give a.No I can't give a card. Yeah I could give him a card and then since this is adjacent I could shore it up..Yeah you can give a card, I would just have to discard one..Mmhmm..Ok.Ok.So.Here.Give me this one..I'll discard this one since you have the air one already I can-.(--).We can both like try and give you the- so discard this one into the dicard pile.Ok.um and then.Ok.and I'm gonna shore this up.Perfect.Ok cool alright, you gotta draw your cards.Ok cool.Yeah.Alright so.I have a treasure and Sandbags..Nice..And then Whispering and Lost Lagoon. So Lost Lagoon is officially sunk..So.So you can put that with the card.Ok..Take that out.And Whispering Garden.Right here.It's Flooded yeah..Ok.I'll put that (--) thanks..Ok..Ok um alright. so my turn then?.Um so I guess I will.Um.Shore up this one right? cause I can shore,.I can move,.and then I can capture the treasure and those could be my three moves right?.Mmm.Shore, move and then.Um wait.so the current the.You can't go.Oh yeah you can't go diagonal cause you're an Engineer right?.No no no but I can I can't.Move diagonal.And shore.Or.Oh you're not even moving there anyway. you're just- Ok I gotcha..Yeah yeah..The concern I have then we'd is (--) that ok we have howling Garden and Whispering Garden so.Um so there's a possibility that.um is there a possibility that ah.you might draw a flood that would be Whispering Garden?.No Whis- unless we draw a Water's Rise, we're not gonna draw Whispering Garden..Ok and then that's a risk in itself. So I mean.I think that's a risk we take.Could you.but also.Mmm.Um.so is that- this was the Cave of Embers, so it's- you can move, shore up both.I could.Mmm..move back and then you can.hmm.We also have two Sandbag cards. So if we have to play one we can play one on Whispering Garden..um.There are two Sandbags. We also have two Helicopter which we could save one in case for Fool's Landing..But technically it's like.Something we could do is she could play.She.Helicopter move you wherever so you could.So like I could move here, get both of these, she could Helicopter Lift me to there.Mmhmm..And then I could capture the treasure..Right?.Yeah.Mm yeah..Is, it's yeah you can play at any time right? With the Helicopter?.Yeah you definitely could play the Helicopter at any time..Ok..It doesn't have to be my turn..Ok yeah so we can do that and we can capture as your third..Ok..So I'll move here..Yup.Alright that's one turn right?.Mmhmm..Flip both of these..You'll Helicopter lift me here right? Discard that..and so we use that yeah?.And discard these four to capture the fire..Nice ok..Rock on..Cool..Alright..Alright nice. So then I get two of these..There you go..Yeah..Ok..Definitely give one of those to you when it's my turn..One, two floods..Yup.What do we got here?.ah Howling Garden, Iron Gate.ok Iron Gate is officially sunk..Howling Garden..Ok..you have the card for Iron Gate?.Ok so this is the only ones Flooded. Oh that and Temple of the Moon ok..Alright so now it's my turn um..Mm. ok I don't th-.I think.there's no point in me giving you guys any cards right now..Yeah I think you should get close to me and.her.me and the Pilot..You and the Pilot? Ok..Yeah so we can give you a card basically.Cause we both have the one you need.And then also.And there's the Temple of.We'll be close enough to eachother where we can both try and give her our card of the air..Ok..Um, so I think you moving here.And then.Shoring up and then moving down one..The question is do we, do we really- is there- do we really need to shore that one up if we're gonna if we could just focus on this one?.It's true we could get rid of it.Cause we have this one, we just need three- we just need two more. so we could try to focus on getting either these two or.And then.These two.That's true. Then you could maximize the amount of moves you could take..And ah, I could use a Sandbag..Um Howling Garden instead..And if we focus on getting the statue here instead of that one..Yeah and then we can get rid of all these three together cause we don't even need them if we go- once we get the statue..Yeah and then I, and then I need to use a Sandbag- I could use a sandbag cause I already have five so then that would.Wait could I fly- for my turn could I fly anywhere?.You get to fly anywhere, yeah so you could fly there..as one action like.But can I do it like.As two actions?.What do you mean?.So like if.You were to.Oh.Get closer here.maybe I could fly up.That's true..shore this and fly back..That's true if you moved three as your turn.Ok.She could then move.Just so we're keeping.Shore,.Move,.the ones like this so we don't-.just in case.Well wait actually.Ok.No I'm not sure we could do that cause if you move three to get on to the same one as her.Mmhmm..She has to take one turn by giving you a card, so then she can only do two things.Mmhmm..Yeah so she can't shore and then move back..Although you could just-, you could just move then shore and then you don't need to move back because you already gave the card.And then just stay there.Or what's this Sandbag?.Sandbag is just to shore up any card- any tile at any time..So.So yeah I mean-.I don't even need to move for this then.Yeah I have a Sandbag as well so I could um.Yeah.Ok.Just Sandbag that.I can move three.And then when it's your turn you can.trade with me.Oh.And also Sandbag that one..Yeah.And also Sandbag it if you really want to yeah. Yeah we could do that. So you want me to do that? All three moves as a turn? (--) all three turns?.We.yeah.Yeah I think that's the best yeah..Yeah.Ok so I'll do that..One, two.Alright two.three and then I'll Sandbag..Is it ok if I sandbag Howling Garden?.Yeah I think that's smart..Ok.Do that, Sandbag, ok..And pick up two cards.Two cards of a flood..And then you gotta get rid of one also, or do you know? I guess you don't cause the Flood is yeah discarded..Mm..No..So this has a Water's Rise.(--) I'll move that up, and then you pick up- shuffle..Ah that's three..two.three.so Bridge, Whispering Garden and Cliffs of Abandon..Breaker's Bridge..Yeah sorry, yeah Breaker's Bridge sorry and Cliffs of Abandon..And what was the third one?.Nice.Yeah right there so.Ok cool.(--) ok..Alright cool so I think it's.Alright so first thing we do is give you this.Ok so that's one action. And I have to dis- yeah I can discard this since we already have it..No wait..Yeah.I can't.Yeah I can cause we're on the same one.Yeah.Yeah so I'll discard that and give me that.Um ok.(--).So three.Um.Then you can fly.I could.shore this.I could do these. I could do-.Yeah I think you should.I think you should shore up one of the closer ones cause I don't think we're gonna need this because once it's my turn I can give it to him.Yeah.You can just go right there yeah..And then he can just grab this one real quick so we don't even need this one really if it comes down to it.But just because this one's in the middle maybe we should do that one..I would shore this one. Ah we the next Flood cards out of the Flood cards are coming, I know this is one of them. Um.I mean Whispering Garden's if we'd lose that that's not a big deal cause there's nothing we need to reach with it and then we could just focus on getting it from here..Yeah true..So, I would, I would shore up Cliffs of Abandon.Ok I think Cliffs of Abandon's a smart choice..Ok..Ok so that's.And then I'd.Two actions take one more action.Stay where you are.I don't know what do you think? Last action. I guess you could shore up one more just because-.Ah.That's (--).Might as well.Might as well.Might as well? Ok..Yeah alright cool..Alright and two.treasures for you.Oh thanks..Ok..What'd you get?.So you got two of them? Ok..Yeah and then another Helicopter..Then.You had Temple of the Moon, so that one's sunk..Top one..Ok so (--).And then Howling Garden's is flooded..Ok so.Alright and then (--) could do that. Alright so I think I should.Definitely.Um.Move.and give each of you my cards.As my turn.Because then she'll have three and you'll have the fourth one for.ah the statue..So that would be all of your three turns by moving.Yeah.Oh I see ok..And then I, I think that's the best way cause I don't, I couldn't.So move one, two cards.Unless you Helicopter Lifted me somewhere I wouldn't be able to.Save either of these and I think getting you the cards is more important right now especially since we're probably running lower on time. We're probably at least half way through already..Ok..Ok alright so you'll know.so I'll move here and then I'll give you one card..Ok..Ok..and (--) your one card..Ok..And I have to discard one of these so..Yeah I think you're getting rid of that. so- Yes that way you can give her..This one?.I need the Lion and I could.Ok gotcha, ok..That, although wait..Like what (--) like both of those?.Oh wait, I need to discard one..I think you discard one of the Helicopter ones..Yeah..I would say so yeah.Ok.Oh wait.Yeah ok yeah sorry..Cause I've.I should probably ok.Ok..So then now I pick up two cards.(--).Right. Yeah..Wow that was really convenient..Alright so we have Crimson Forest and Copper Gate..Ah.Um.Lose Copper Gate.And Crimson Forest.Alright cool.Alright, I think.Right.Now I think you should, I realize you can't give that to her and get down here..Oh sorry three, sorry three. So Cave of Embers as well. So that's flooded..Oh.My bad.No problem.Alright so that one doesn't even matter cause it's fire and we already got that so.Alright for your turn, I realize that you can't give her that card..Mmhmm..And move two and capture. So I think you should worry about capturing..You want me to capture? Ok..Over.getting and then what she could.yeah.yeah I would capture.And then she could Helicopter Lift you there.And then doesn't worry about moving..We, we don't know how certain we are to get a Helicopter Lift again which we need to get off the island. So I, I think it's.really?.important to have always one..Helicopter Lift between us three..I think that's probably true. I think that's a safe play..cause.Ok.Yeah that's a safer it's riskier,it's less risky. I think I could.So I think I could, I think you should use a Sandbag to save either Howling Garden or Whispering Garden because.Yeah we definitely need to save one.Yeah.Um, I think you should use one of yours right now to save either one. I think, I think this one is probably best cause it's closer to where we'll need to exit..Yeah I think that's smart..Ok..Um.I'll do that right now..Ok..Alright cool..Do that, I will so you guys just- I'll just move and capture. Ok. I'll do that..I think you should.Yeah.Yeah I think that's the smartest choice..Alright..So two and then.use my-.these to capture.ok, awesome alright and then I'll get.nice.Alright cool and then draw.two cards.two So I have a chalice and.iron and then three.floods.So I have Coral Palace.Dunes of Deception and Silver Gate..Coral Palace.Ok.Who's.So Coral Palace is wait ah.Oh.What you guys are on right now ok..So that one Dunes of Deception's right here..And Silver Gate's right here. Ok..Yeah.There you go. Ok so it's your turn now..Ok gotcha..Alright.Um.So.Everyone.I think you, I think staying where you are.would be.Oh we still have this one, ok..would be prudent because.Ah.Do I want to get to him so I can get the li-.card.Hmm.Actually you know what we could do? Oh wait, you could fly, you could move yourself to him.Yeah I would shore up.Which would be one turn and you could give him two of your cards.Beacuse his turn comes up sooner..Right?.and then you have all four rather than.like us giving one to you. I don't know if that would work..So if you're giving me all four which means I would have to take.three turns to see if you can get there so the next turn we're not guaranteed to get a statue..That's also true..Um.So I could just fly to this statue..Yeah that is true. That's true. yeah That's smart. yup?.Yeah cause it's.It's most convenient..Ok alright so I would say one is to shore up that..Ok..Yeah, yeah definitely..That you're on Coral Palace.Mmhmm..I say that's for sure..Ah you don't have to do two more actions but ah.So I mean.Ah let's see.Would you like to do anything else? Would like to move anywhere? Is there any reason for you to move anywhere?.Um.Might as well just.Ah yeah.Do you see any reason to do anything else you don't have to?.Well you could.I was gonna say I could move here and shore up.another statue thing just in case but we already have this..Hmm, no I think you should move one down..to get closer to him?.Or you could.You could fly anywhere to and you don't.Yeah, yeah you know what I mean.Yeah.Yeah if you're closer to him that's smarter.Cause then it.Doesn't take effort. He doesn't have to waste a move by.then why don't I just do that cause.Ok so just move one ok.cause (I) could fly anywhere yeah..Alright and then two treasures and three.Alright.Floods.You'll have to discard one so just get rid of the fire..Three, four, five..Yeah..Alright so you got Bronze Gate's. Tidal Palace which is there..What do we get?.Oh..And then was it Temple of the Sun?.oh.Is right here..where I am on.Hmm..Ok.Ok.Hmm.OK.Alright so it's my turn. I basically just need these and you have one..Mmhmm..So.I think what I can do is.I have one two.You also have one yeah true..Keep in mind that you don't have to be on the tile that I'm on for me to give you it, cause I'm the Messenger..mmhmm.Yeah um.So.Ok I think I should.I think.I can shore up two by moving here and get.oh my gosh shit.both of these and that way Whispering Gard- I mean you know, I don't know we don't want the whole map to sink but the main important ones are really right here and those are fine right now..So what I'm thinking I totally forgot because of my special ability , I'm able during my turn to give you guys cards no matter where you're at so.Oh wow.if you wanted.so you could just give me that. Ok..So if you were to just move to that one you were to just move to.Guess where you're at..Oh.Right..So if you did want I just go here real quick.Yeah true.get these two move back.Get them just in case and then.Yup and then move back if you wanted to..Ok yeah let's do that so one turn..Get both of these..And move back. That's the end of my turn. I draw two cards..ok that's it.Ok.Ok Helicopter Lift and Water's rise. So water's rise we're still only collecting three luckily..Ok I'll shuffle these and then.We're probably gonna lose..Well.yeah we're probably gonna lose at least one..That's fine we don't, we don't care if we lose any really. Ok so three of them. One, two.Yeah alot of them in the corner we don't really need..Let's see what we got here. Ok Crimson Forest.Three..Crimson Forest.Ah.Top one, done..Hmm..Ah Coral Palace..Three you're up..Um yup.I know..Since it's flooded..Whoops..Ok..And then Dunes of Deception also flooded..Ok..Alright cool..Alright so now it's my turn so I'll use my special ability twice..Um.And I'll give.you one.I'll give you one. You have to discard one of yours so..This one..Ok..Alright so that's my two abilities and then..I will start moving to Fool's Landing. I-.I'll just move..to here cause that's my third one..I don't know if we even have to be on Fool's Landing.when we leave as long as.we do.Yeah we do.We must, I mean that so like we all get on and then you use the Helicopter Lift to get us off, so I'll move..Oh I thought as long as we have the Helicopter..Ok..Yeah I have one too now luckily..Ok and then I'll take two treasure..Ok..these and then three.floods.so Tidal Palace.So that one's.sunk.Ah Bronze gate that one's sunk as well and then.Hmm.Ok.Ok.Um ok I think you should definitely shore up the one I'm on..Ok.Oh first it yeah..So we can't loose that. And then and then capture..You can fly..then um.fly and capture that third one..yeah alright..two cards..And then.Two cards, that's it..for my third ac- oh I guess I already-, ok.No that was all three yeah..That was all three actions they did.I already get three of these..So.Alright so Temple of the Sun.Right here (--) sunk ok..Two.done.Ah Copper Gate sunk..And the Cliffs of Abandon..Right here. That's flooded. Ok..Ok..Ok cool. SO it's my turn now. right..So you can- one action there..I will yeah do one action,.Um get rid of that..And then what I think we should do is I should move here..Right?.As my second action (--) here and then I can Helicopter Lift you to where we are..Ok.Ok..Ok..do that alright.And then.Um.There's no reason, (--) I don't have it do anything and then you need two cards right?.Yeah thanks. Draw two cards..You draw three..oop that's four..(--) so we got Breaker's Bridge..One, two, three..Cave of Embers..Here, is that sunk?.And Whispering Garden..Ok. Alright cool..So that was mine. I won't do anything. I don't see any reason to do anything. So..Ok..Yeah so we just gotta pick up two..Just take two..Alright, Water's rise..So, put that (--) to four..Now you gotta do four cards..so shuffle do four..So far we haven't had Fool's Landing yet..It's actually really good yeah, because now we cannot even pick up anything that's fool landing (--). take it..Alright..That's sunk..Breaker's Bridge..Sunk..Sunk, Whispering Gardens. Sunk..Mmm..Whispering Garden..And Cliffs of Abandon, sunk..Ok..Yeah..Ok so now you can fly.Alright..to us cause that's your abil-.and then use your Helicopter and then we're off..then Use this.That's it..OK.",s,sd  %  %  sd  %  sd  b  b  sv  sd  aa  sd  sv  sv  b  b  ba  %  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  b  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  ba  sd  sd  b  sd

I don't think there would be two cause we'll have to put.yeah.two of them in there..Yeah right.Both of them in that. Ok. Yeah..Ok.So should I pull these three?.Yeah.Yeah you're right..Howling Garden..Crimson Forest and Copper Gate..Howling Garden..Copper.Hmm Crimson Forest.Ok so we definitely need to shore this up.And that.Um.Yeah.Um it's my turn.So.I'll mo-.m-.move.Wait hold on a second.

Should we try and get these two?.Yeah.Yeah so I'm gonna move there and shore it up and then you guys can meet me there..Do we wait.What would be the fastest way to do this?.Do we all have to be on the same tile though?.Um I did.If we-, wait- if you give a treasure you have to be on the same tile correct?.to give a- but unless you are the-.I don't have to be.She doesn't have to be.You don't have to be?.Ah.But can you give more than two because would it make more sense to try and like um.You give it to him and I move to him and then he goes there or something.and then I fl-.and then, and then I fly or I only have to fly? yeah..Or like he flies like he moves and gives it me and then I try to go there..Ok so.Or can you only move one card?.Give treasure cards to a player anywhere on the island for one action per card, so it would be two actions. So.Oh yeah.But then so you could do that.I'll shore up Temple of the Moon.Yeah.And then I'll give you.What?.Wait what if you give them.where's I'm here.give them to me I think.Give them to you and then I'll fly and give.He'll give it me and then I can go there. I can go one, two and then get it..yeah.Yeah it's easier to give them to her.That would be my third action.Ok.I think that makes sense.We also need to shore up Howling Garden though.to Engineer.But we have this.Yeah.I have a Sandbag card.Worst comes to worse.Ok, ok, ok so.Yeah we'll be yeah, we'll be fine I think.You can have those so that's three of my actions.That's three oh yeah.Ok.And you have five cards so I'll pull.Mmhmm..Two treasure cards, oh Water's Rise.Not (--).Ok.Um sooo.Shall I look it up for you?.Should we Sandbags?.Oh yeah we can do it now..Alright.Yeah do you want- wanna use.Ok.Or should we save Sandbags in case we like really need it.Yours?.I think we should at least Sandbag Howling Garden so I'm gonna Sandbag Howling Garden..I think we should Sand bag Howling Gardens.Ok.Ok.Um so now I pick three.Cliffs of Abandon, Temple of the Moon.Cirmson Forest.Oh we lost this one..Ok.Ok.So that was it.for me so now it's your turn.Yeah.So it's his turn so he's moving to give the.Ok.the Earth-, I don't know what is it?

We might lose, we might lose one in the mean time..Yeah might.Might as well, cause you can swim to places from there so it's not the end of the world if we.This Temples of the Moon is probably more important since it has this guy in it..You know what though, if, if.if the outer ones sink they're, they're no longer a threat to us cause they go in the box right?.Yeah that's true.Yeah.ok.just so we don't.That's a good point though, we should definitely focus on these ones with the.with the treasure icons on them,.cause they're the important ones..Yeah.Um.so I'll definitely shore up this one.um.and then I guess I'll.move here.Doesn't.Well.Does it matter if I move or not?.yeah you could maybe shore up.Yeah maybe shore up Breaker's and give that- a chalice to the Pilot.Yeah.Ok.Just so we.been trying to.I think we were trying to get him one too..Yeah.So there's two chalices right?.Mmhmm.We can grab.Mmhmm.But all we have to do is capture em.We have to have four of em.Mmhmm.(--).and be at that spot..Four cards in just one person.Mmhmm.Yeah.Ok, treasure card.Can I ask you a question.about the rules or.No.Ok.What?.So.I.Do you know if it's, if it's someone elses turn can they give me a card if I move to their space?.Or is it only you can give a card on your own turn?.Yeah I don't know.You have to be on your own turn cause it counts as an action.I think you have to give yeah.Oh.Yeah I don't think you can take.Ok.Yeah.Alright.Um so I drew those.Two sandbags.the four.We also, we also have two of these if we decide to use them..Unless I give you my.um.lion.I have um.two sandbags I can, I can shore up two tiles at anytime..Yeah.Nice.Um.how do they work again?.Sandbags.Just play it at anytime and it can.shore up any island,.any tile..Right.Yeah.Um and it doesn't count as an action..So I don't know when we wanna use these.I know, we gotta, we gotta make sure- We probably wanna use them on this if that comes up.Does that.Mmhmm.Cause we don't want that to sink.Yeah.So maybe I should save them for now since we haven't really lost much.Did Whispering Garden just get hit or it didn't?.(--).Like it's already been shuffled back in..And like that.Was it.I- Was it started that way?.or.I don't remember.It's been- I think it, I'm pretty sure it's in the deck..I don't know are we allowed to look at these, I don't know..So maybe we wanna.I don't think so.Ok.That's the one.I don't think it was one of the three that recently got.Didn't say we weren't allowed to.That's the one that maybe we wanna save just cause it has the lion thing.Yeah.But um- Cause then I can give you my lions during my turn and you- Cause you are- cause you can only hold five anyway..That's true um ok.But these don't count towards the five though.Oh they don't?.I thought the special action ones do.Oh you're right, you're right..I'm not sure..Yeah I don't think they count..Oh they don't count towards your five cards?.Oh ok.Oh that's good.I'm not positive..threasure cards.Including them, actually..Yeah.Oh it does include them..Ok.Ok.Yeah you can play them at anytime..They do not count as an action but you can't sandbag something once it's sunk..Yeah.Yeah.I'm just wondering what if we get.two Fool's Landings at the same pull and that thing's gone.Well we can't though, we'll have to get a Water's Rise. There's only one for each. But then if we get a Water's Rise in between then we can get Fool's Landing..Yeah.You know what I mean?.Because like.Right.Yeah.this one is still.it's still, like it's close to the top, we know that.Alright.so that's the only thing.but.(--).Oh I see what you're saying, we know it's not near, there couldn't,.It's up to you.there cannot be two near the top.Right.so far..Ok.Yeah, only the ones that are flipped have the chance of getting eliminated..Ok.I'll use my, I'll use one of these sandbags on um.Ok.Whispering Garden..Ok, then I'll draw my flood cards..Cool.Uh.these ones first right?.He did, he did this, yeah.Did you already- You already did that?.I already did, I did those, yeah..I'll take three of these.oh wow..Good call with that..So Whispering Garden,.Ok.Iron Gate,.But is it to our advantage just to let these outer ones sink?.gone..and go away?.Oh sorry.But not if they have that, the statues on them, that's what we need..I don't know..Um.Like cause we need to be at one of these places..True, ok.Ok, and the Cliffs of Abandon.Ok it's right there..Now I guess if the card goes away we do go down deeper (--).Right, yeah.K.Alright.so.I don't really have many idea about.what to do.Oh you might wanna grab.um.Oh nevermind, we can't.Whispering Garden isn't shuffled in yet.But.You're on chalice.I can move- What if I move here and then.uh shore up both of these two?.Can you fl-.Yeah.You can fly anywhere at once?.Mmhmm.I mean you're already in a good spot if we could get you these two cards you could.capture.Yeah.But then next turn I can just fly right back.Yeah.If you end your turn where I am I can give you this.TRUE.Uh chalice.Wait you are.ok.I can end at the Cliffs.or close to there, I mean,.either way..I don't know it might be.Whether you fly there for one turn.That's one ac- you could get.Yeah or we could fly there and shore up two.You might wanna get.I feel like we should get Whispering Garden again since we already.been trying to save it.Mmhmm.Ok wait does it.Does shoring up.Shoring up is one action.Ok.Mmhmm.Ok.so I could fly and shore up two.or.yeah.Yeah that's not bad.and then you could use one of your.turns to move.Yeah.Yeah.so.So I'll do that..Thanks.Oh.Treasure.Alright, yeah treasure.So we got fire.and.the other one..Oh shoot.but now we have to.So yeah I have to discard now..So.what don't we need?.So I'm gonna definitely keep these guys.Mmhmm.I feel like the Helicopters could come in handy later.Yeah definitely..Um.Yeah after this card.Yeah.Maybe the li- maybe a lion, since.he's got two lions already.Since you guys already have the four.then.Yeah.Ok.Earth or fire?.I guess maybe the.there is one.then I can.give the fire to you at some point..Yeah.not a bad idea..Where's discards go, on the top?.Yeah.Yeah we can't get them back though..They're gone..Yeah that's fine..Does seem right..Yeah.Gotta.pick something.and then uh.the flood cards..K.Crimson Forest,.Temple of the Sun,.and Phantom Rock..Crimson Forest is this guy.Phantom Rock's gone..Uh.Unless she's flipped it.No I don't.No.Ok.So there you go,.these guys go.Over there.Ok.alright so.Actually now that I'm thinking about it maybe I'll just give you both of these.so you can complete the.um.Ok..lion (--).One, two, three, shoot..Or I could.hmm.never mind..Maybe we should- I could just come to you..Yeah I can play this at anytime, I could move one of you.where you need to go..Hmm.That's true.I don't know if we need.need that yet.

Five tar- five cards total?.Now I have six though.Mmmmm.So maybe get rid of.Yeah.Oh no well no cause I have these three right..So I have six so I have to get rid of.you could.so.get rid of probably the.Yeah.That one.Chalice if we're not going for it.Right.Alright.And then I need three flood cards.We have.Watchtower.Right here.Ok.And then Misty March.And Temple of the Sun.Temple of the Sun, ok..which is.this one.These all go here.Ok I'm done.Alright.Ok so.I'll give you.This.No you have to be on the same. You have to be on the same one.You have to move.You'll have to move twice- two.Oh ok.So.One, two I keep thinking you're the gray one.Right.Um.That's one.One, two, that was two.Two moves ok.Two right? and then three.Ok and then we get this.So do we.Ah we have to get.Oh.(--).If you want to use one of the Sandbags.to save.Cause you can only have five at a time.Oh.So you c-.Ok so I could do that. Yeah let's do the Sandbag.Right you could use up the Sandbags.And maybe save Watchtower.Cause you guys are both on it right now? Yeah.Yeah cause we don't want two of us swimming on there right? That wouldn't be cool, ok.Yeah.Um.Ok that goes in there.Ok.Ah.But you still get to, you still get.Um.Ok.And then.But don't you have to get rid of the Helicopter one too?.No.No.Cause there's.Right cause you can get up to five.Oh there's five.Right.Right ok.So I have four and then do I take- wait for my turn to take this.Yeah you have to get over here first.Yeah.Ok.Ok.Yeah.Um.(--).So two treasure cards.those did you.Did I just give you those?.(--).No.Ah no.Ok.No.Um ok Helicopter and then.Move water level up a tick.Ugh.Um shuffle the flood card.The flood discard pile and place it on top of the flood draw pile.Discard.I feel like I could be responsible for.Yeah.the flooding.Discard, this card in the treasure discard pile.finally.um.you get to pick three.and then.Three of these I guess.Oh three.But we're pretty close.Bronze Gate.So.Get rid of that.Watchtower.We're on it.Ok.That was good that was that was.Oh no.That was here.Ok.Yeah that was.Ok.Yeah that was good.Good thought.Um Dunes of Deception.Alright.Ok.flipped.Ok.um.All set there.And then I.That's it.Drew ok yeah.These are your treasure cards so you're- you're good.Ok.Yeah.Now what is the.Ok.Helicopter Lift.You could use that at any time.

Team2852.csv,"Cool..K so I'm the Engineer so.Um I'm thinking of asking for advice but I'm thinking one of my actions should be to shore up two flooded.Yeah.tiles next to me. What do you guys think?.I was, I was thinking shore up these, move here then shore up both of these and get all four at the same time..I think that's an awesome idea so I'm choosing to do that for my two actions, thanks for the good advice..Um I'm gonna take my um.two actions like.Ah.that.Well not in that order but it would be.No.C-Ca.Oh well.This.(She's alread-).This, this, then this tehn this..Yeah he's right..He's right thanks for your help.It means irrelevant but.Well no your right, we should.That works better following the rules.Proceed in proper order you're absolutely right.Cool you're.Hmm.Right.And then um she can go.No, no, no.And she yeah, you need to.Um.Oh we gotta draw treasure cards, can you hand me, sorry I really can't reach.Draw.Two.Or.There and.What did you get (fuck).Just so you guys can see unfortunately I did pick a Water's Rise card so.Um.Thank you (so she grabbed it) and we all know what that means.It says we gotta move the water level up one tick mark.And we now have to shuffle the discard pile and put it on top.(And put it in the) oh I'm sorry guys.And put it in top of the draw pile.Discard this to the treasure.I can't reach where do I put it thank you..Ok.Draw two.Hm.Two-what.Yeah.It's gonna be.These.Over here, maybe this one..Yeah um it's like he said.Yeah.Oh not (oh we're not) Golden Gate.Move one of the one's that you flipped.Golden Gate.Oh good it's not a bad thing.Hmm.probably not.So that's why we saved it.Yeah.Ah what's (--) ah.What's the other one.That's (bigger).(fuck me).Golden Gate.Hm.That's unfortunate.Ok.Well.I'll take that.(we lost one, but (--)).(--) so I don't.Ok.It doesn't matter, we don't have a yellow, there's no treasure. We need to.I know.I know.Make sure we just keep at least one of these so you have to save them at all costs.Yeah.Yeah.Three.Sounds like a good strategy to me in fact it sounds like you played this before.And Fool's Landing.No it's just a very very simple board game..(great) idea..So I don't know..So then I can go um.K.This.What do you wanna do?.So I should just.Go one.Mmm.Mmm.I don't know.Ok You know you also have special ability, um I think.your biggest.thing you could do to help us is you have the ability to give things to.Yeah.people so for example like.give me.the gold one there and I can focus on this.That way.She's gonna get the chalices, well she'll knock that out.I can knock this out.We could focus on her having these we'll see like where cards go.Yeah and I could give you this one cause.Yeah.Right.You know what I mean? So you should be giving things once per turn I think.Yeah.Ok then draw this.See whoever has the most.Ok.Let's see, you're the only one who can do that most easily. She should be saving all the tiles from dying..Now, here?.yeah.I don't like it.yeah I agree I just traded (--).And then you can fly us away so we don't get lost. Yeah see now if you give me that extra one I'll have three of them now.Alright.Sounds good.Mmm.yeah.Right.I can move simply here and get that.Yeah.(that's awesome).Oh no.(--).I don't think I can take another turn.So (This one).Draw.That was it?.Phathom Rock and Cliffs of Abandon.Ok (it's gone, give me the Phantom Rock).Take that.And what's the other one?.Cliffs of Abandon.Cliffs of Abandon.Oh.Which I'm on.Ok that's ok you're not done yet.That's ok because we could.I'm right next to it and I can go and (--).Ok.So I can fly myself anywhere.Yes ma'am.Yeah you can.Yes.So tch tch.Do you want to fly youself?.And you have the ability to do those as well.um.I'm thinkin' of.What do we think here (again).Cause if I fly myself over to Lost Lagoon, I can flip Lost Lagoon over.(--).And save that.Or Cliffs of Abandon since somebody's on it and you could still.Don't go there.If you draw a Water Rise card then you would have to put.Yeah.This back and.but if it's gone it sort of doesn't matter, it's not one that's really important um..Yeah.Right cause it's.Plus I'm next to it and I can save it on my next turn.Right l-.On your turn yeah but.Ah see you, we think, you're going to be the most mobile.Rigth.So you need to choose what you think you're gonna get so I think your you could end up getting, let's see, you kinda gonna see what you're gonna get.I.Right.Yeah to be honest with you.If you pull out a couple more of these then that's what you're going to be going with.Right.Cause you can just fly yourself to whatever one and gather the treasures easily.To wherever I want.Right.So right now probably go ahead go Lost Lagoon, flip it over.And then.Yeah cause it's closest to the treasure (--).Try and save it yeah, I mean (--) there's no.Yeah try and save it.So.Oh.Save that one.Because I could save the one next to me so yeah.And limit somewhat.And now you can you could just end your turn, you don't need to take all three.Right.Cause it doens't like.It does matter where I go right no? ok. So and then two of these..Not really.Yeah like we'd all.yup.I'm gonna just put this back here..And I got a Helicopter.Hmm?.And I want, so be careful you can't draw anymore cards.So you're close to her.Right.Yeah.So maybe next time you want to give her.Right.that.If she doesn't draw it by then.Oh.So (--).And then two.Let's see what happens..Yep.Oh no.Temple of the Moon and Breaking Bridge.Ok.Ok.That's not good.Can't lose this one.But.You know what I can save two on my turn so it doesn't matter I'm just gonna (--).Breaker's Bridge, yeah.Yeah.But, there's a fifty percent chance that when those go back in there it's gone anyway before it gets to you..Maybe.So and I can't get there in time.Potentially.Alright.Ok my turn ah so I don't really.Ok now you're turn.You can go diagonal.think that I need to save, well, the only thing I really need to do is make sure that we don't lose this, so I'm gonna save that.Yeah thank thank you..Oops.Um nothing else is very important at the moment.Ah so I think I'm gonna move there save that and then.MMm.Move myself back down here to be within range to get this.Cool.When I need to.I'll take two treasure cards please..Which I didn't really want.That should be for you..And you need this one..Yeah.Ah now let's see what we got.Well (--).So we got lucky we didn't get a water rising cause we could have potentially lost everything..Right.Yup.I know I'm sorry I (--).Whispering Garden we gotta be careful. (We) can't lose that..And Iron Gate.Alright.ah oh.(--).(can).Alright I guess it's my turn and I could use.Yeah.Um advice now.It would probably be good if I took one of my actions and flipped that back over huh?.Well you can flip both of them, this and this?.Flip both of them..Yeah I can do two that's right..No.What did you say sir?.Sorry.It's on vibrator honey.Oh.It's not on mute..Yeah it's just.Both.Ok so yeah I will.take my action and.do that.Eh where.Do you guys think I should do a second action like?.Give her this card so she can.Ah.You know what I mean? Make a match..Maybe.Ah.um.You need, you're gonna eventually going to hopefully get the ah.The.This Water Chalice so you need to acta- you need to start getting close to it.green ones.I know.But I don't need this one.It's over there..So I'm thinking I could give you this one.Well only if you're on the same tile as her.Oh I'm not, I'm not.I beleive or if it's if you're adjacent.Give a single. Nope same tile..Um.Same tile.Ok well I'm not.Ah so gray. So if you want to, you could move here.And then give that to her and then that would be your.Yeah I think.That'd be two actions.I think I want to do that cause there's nothing else I could really save next to me unfortunate.Right.No.Ok I'm gonna do what he said.Well you gotta go on to, right..Well yeah.an-.You got it..I know. I know I was about to..Ok.Um thanks guys..It's your turn..Ok no two of these.No, no no, no no..No we gotta yeah..(--).What'd you get?.Ok.I'm very sorry cause.Water Rise? Yeah..I got bad luck but.Um.Water Rise so I guess I gotta move that up.And then.Well first you move it up.Move up the water level one tick mark.What?.Yeah move it up.Oh wait (--).Up to three.Yeah.Then.shuffle those up.Ok.And we're gonna lose.Ok the Water Rise card will come back over here..Hopefully not Whispering Garden, or else I have to move alot.Ok.Like he said we're gonna shuffle these up..And.Too many of these God damn.Ok.Discard this card.to the top of the treasure pile sorry guys.And the other one.is this one..Right.Yeah.Yeah, yeah, yeah ok now keep drawing the three.Draw the three.Yeah.Ah.Lost Lagoon.Do you.Were we.was it here before?.Yeah it was at two.yeah.Yeah this.Y- Ok.It was at two, now it was, now it's.Right so it's on the bottom.(little).It's not up, yeah it's not up to.Oh.Sorry.Well you moved it up two, we don't want to be up there.I'm.Cri- No we don't.Alright.Alright well I have Lost Lagoon, Whispering Garden and (--).Draw another one. You have to draw three. And this is gone that's not what I wanted..You.need three cards.Yeah that's what I thought.And I also have the Temple of the Moon.Ok this one's gone.Hmm.So no.Sorry.That's not good. Lost Lagoon.Yeah he's right.Eh it's over he- it's over here next to her.Temple of the Moon.Ah and then Temple of the Moon's right there.Mm I'm under Lost Lagoon.That's ok.But she's ok because.Well so we lost one of, so now I have to be over there.I'm sorry guys..Yeah.God.It's not your fault. It's statistics..I know..Because the way they keep putting the same cards (--).Ok um so I'm going to.Ok your turn.fuck.So you're able to give pieces right?.Give him this..yeah that's a discard so.Ok.And.then.Should I.Ah draw these so I can get rid of.Well maybe not give her give you that until.Should I flip.this over since I'm right by it?.No.That's a good ide-yeah-ahh.No?.Since it has the one thing.Ah.What are you, you gonna do.I mean have make choices at some point. Like we already lost one of the yellow, yellow ones, it's just gonna happen.Yeah.I know.Um.(It's a game, yeah).We're gonna have to rely on her Helicopter Lift to get us to.like that should be our way to move to the places where we can capture treasures at so.That makes sense.But if you want to yeah there's nothing else you can do that this moment um.Yeah.So I'm just gonna.flip this over..Yeah you need to go to it and then flip it over..Oh.So you're on that now..Yeah so that's.Ok so.You also have Sandbag's so you can just, you could have saved it without.Oh.Well she can save, she can save another one without.Um it's not important.Well eventually she can save well.So she has three turns right? So can't she?.that's if.Well that was, that was all three.I already took.Oh ok.Those three.That's ok cause now you're gonna, so now you're gonna have five and you pull those two and you won't have to discard anything yet..Mmhmm.So it was smart to give away one to me..Yeah so I got Sandbags and another one..Now you have two Sandbags..That's the one I want.(name$$$).No, don't you have these?.Shh.(--).(--) Cliffs of A-.bandon.Can I, can I see them?.Shhh.Cliffs of Abandon.What's the other one?.Ahh.Breakers.Iron Gate, so we lost that..(--).Gone I'll take that.sorry did you say Iron Gate? Ok.No that's the wrong one.And Breaker's Bridge.Ok.Sorry.And Breaker's Bridge yeah.ok.Ok that's ok.Ok.Ok.Ok now.Let's just c- these count as actions right?.Mmm.Yeah, no.They don't count (playdate) does not count as an action, excellent. Alright.So I can.K.Um.I can fly anyone, anywhere.Yeah I kinda want you to use one of those.So where do you want to fly cause I gotta get rid of a card.I want. I want to go here..Ok go there..I wanna.Ok.have this and capture that.And then.I can fly myself anywhere that we need.Or.Yup.And I can also flip something over.And I can flip two more (--).Ok.Yeah we don't, you dont have to use it right now I mean, unless you wanna fly. Don't.So.Save this.Right, I'm saving that.No I'm saving it for later, yeah (--).But.why don't I flip two cards.Cause I have.Can you flip two cards?.Or can I have f.No she only flipped one.Only I can.So if you want to just fly yourself somewhere and just save a tile that's fine..Ok.It would be better if this wasn't so contricted.Are they all?.ch, ch, ch, ch what is better to save?.Um.We gotta save something. Probably this one huh?.Yeah but you can't.I think this cause the.The n- Lost Lagoon, because once we right.Cause one way we can lose is if.Yeah.They're stranded. So if we would have got rid of here.Yeah.Right.They would have had limited ability to get out of there. You're the only one who can fly away from everything and I can move diagonally so I can skip easily too..Right.Mmm.But I can't.But they can.Right.Um so that was it for you unless you want to fl.So that's.That's two moves right?.That's.Well.Well you flew yourself there to do that.I was there.Oh you're blue.I'm blue. So I was there..Ok yeah.So I got one more.So.It might be smart.Um.I'm going to fly here.with me ?.with you only because I can do s.two people I can move two.You can move us both.yeah.Oh (--).If need be at some point.What?.What are you pointin' at.only once per turn.Oh I think she, she didn't fly.she was here.You started here didn't you?.(choo).Yeah.Yeah I started there.(shoo).Then she flipped it, then she flew here..She never actually flew anywhere..Right I never moved myself..(shoo).She used.Helicopter Lift to fly me..Yeah she didn't actually play them.Yeah.Which is different then hers.Um.Ok so now this.See what you draw.Hopefully not Waters, Ooooo.Ok.That's very convenient.That's awesome.And then.So either you can give it to me.and I'll capture that or she can give it to me if we're on the same tile.And ch ch ch, three.three.And.Maybe we could trade a bunch and like.Three (st- na- ).Yeah.I could give you that one and you could trade me so I could meet.Messenger, three.Oh.Do you want.that or (--).Mmhmm. Yeah I'm I'm savin' this one for you..Three not four..No I keep grabbing.Cool.I'm saving this one for you.Oh ok.Wow, I don't know if I want to be the one that gets it..(--).and you want.Ok Copper Gate.Right.Copper Gate.Copper Gate.What else.Or I could just go over to.Crimson Forest, ok what else.Crimson Forest and Temple of the Sun.Ok Temple of the Sun, we gotta.Ok.Temple of the Moon is there but not the sun.We've.Ok.Shuffe them one two.(oh I thought we were oh ok).Ok.So now.Mm.k you're turn, so.It's your turn.Yeah so I really can't.I don't even really want to.Necessarily do anything.You don't have to.Um.So I want to keep these I wanted to get rid of these two, when I draw two.um.What I can do, cause you already have five, you have five.Ok question.I only have three so.I can't give anything to you..I only got three.two three, one two.No this is not gonna help.If I could get to you in two turns, I could give you this..But I can't, I can only get there in three turns so therefore I'm using all of my actions..But you can't die.Alright well I don't think I can do anything..Um.But can you give it.Cause I don't want to lose these..No you can't give it to me cause I have five cards..Nmhmm..I can't.I only have three but he's not no anywhere near them.Ah.So don't, I could give you like.I could give you.One of these if you think you're cause you're the most mobile like I said, well yeah but you're not gonna you don't need this cause I'm gonna get that.But I have.I have.Like you don't need that one.Yeah (--).You know what I mean? Like once I gather this, it doesn't matter anymore. These are useless then cause I already captured it. So I could give you this or this.Right..Probably this cause she already has two of those.By the end of the day there's.probably at least five times as many as the- of these in there as we need, so.Probably..Um, what do you think? Cause you can go anywhere you want..Makes sense.Well I was thinking if you give me this because we're trying to get all of those to her.Ok that way on my next turn I can tran-f-try- right.you can fly and then trade both.Yeah and then she's pretty close. Ok, I like that..Right..Um.Yeah but you already have five don't you so you're gonna have.Yeah but she'll just get rid of this cause she doesn't need it. You're gonna give me that..Hmm?.(But I don't).Ok.Yeah.You'll get yours.And then I will.Well.We've been getting rid of these.Yeah.Yeah.There.So we might as well stick with getting rid of one subject..Yeah it's a little risky but yeah. I I.Don't know, don't don't know how many cards of each one is in there..No I, I, I like your.I like your thought though.I like your strategy, I'll take that..You know..Although I would have just gotten rid of that. The gold one since you don't need it..Yeah but you don't know how many's in there and we know.No you don't it's.We don't.Yeah.Mainly cause.Ah and that's all I really want to do um cause I'm gonna get rid of this in a minute. Can I have two of those?.to make sure.Cause I'm the one, that I can get to one of those if need be.Yeah Water's Rising (--) another one..K.Alright so, one two three four five.Get rid of this.And this now, raise it up one..Shuffle those back into there..(and we still gotta raise) three.That's not good..Ah-Ay-yeah then just one, two.three, We're gonna lose some things here..Yeah.Copper.Lost Lagoon.Copper gate.Crimson Forest's gone, Copper Gate's gone..K.Ok.K I guess it's my turn. I could use some advice here but.Um and I get up to three turns but I think one obvious move would be to turn this back over.Um.Yeah I mean well.Yeah if you want.Then you save, get rid of that. S-save this one and then move here and save both of those..But I c-.She yeah.I think that's what I was gonna do to (--) like real (honest).So I'm gonna move here. Do what you said..Nn Then save both of them.No.Yeah because we've already lost alot of stuff..And that's the closest I could get to because I can't.Get the (--).Right.Yeah that's fair.And then I'm done cause I have my three actions so can I have two treasure cards, please?.I have a Helicopter Lift that works, not another flooding one..Alright good..And I got this one..And now I have.The um..You don't have to do anything..One two three.Yeah.Yeah I only have five so I'm cool so.You can go now.Okay I'll.give.Yeah give me that ah so now I can capture that. You're gonna want to use at least one of those. So that you don't have to go discard something..(Lost).Ok so how do we use.Um so.But we don't have anything to Sand, well we can sandbag this. Does it have to be the same?.This.Sandbag this one.Does it have to be near me?.Ah let me look..Do, do, do, do, do Flood Cards.What's it say up there? I can't see behind me so.Sandbag.Um.Ssss, ch, ch, ch.Any one tile. So you don't have to.so you can just shore up that which is a good idea cause it is a special one..Then.This goes in here and.Mmhmm.Then you still have one more right? Where are you at?.Yeah umm.You're eventually gonna get red so maybe move right here.Wait no who are you? You're this?.Ah I'm going.Yeah I think cause you're the grey right?.You're eventually gonna get the red treasure cause you have two..Mmhmm..So should I just move to Cliffs of.Yeah you can just move there for now..Mmm..Ok.And that's it..Let's hope it's not a Water's Rise..Ah I got.two.There it is. Ok that's good. So you're gonna eve- You're gonna save that. Um I'm gonna get this so then next turn we'll have two with.Yeah.Yeah.Mmhmm..Ok..Four.Ok.You need one of these.Three of them.I'm it's the Temple of the Moon and Temple of.That was a smart move.The Sun.You need.Ok that's dangerous..Um if we lose both of those.Ah we're gonna be in a prob- no but we're gonna be hard pressed. Cause we can get three out of four and win..We lost all guys.Ok so.(could we).Should.She pulls one more cause she needs a three.Oh yeah.Yeah pull one more..I forgot.Ah.Cliffs of a Abandon.This was in (--).Ok that's ok..That's alright..Ok now what do we need to do here..You.Um.I need to get this.She's gonna get red, I'm getting this.You.I need to get these.do you.You probably.Well guess what I have a Helicopter lift so eventually I could get next to you.to her.You probably shouldn't give me your red though because I already have five things so I have to discard.too.yeah so we're focusing on on her now.Right.Yeah.She can't accept anything else except to get rid of.no.Ah.Earth.Well we only need three pieces right? So.Yeah.Yeah I've got one, two..Correct.One, two, so if she collects all of them.Oh I got two.Focus on these, cause we might lose both of these.So.Because if she collects all the blue.Uh yeah we get that one.Then she can discarde both.The purple, gray and then that would work.Yeah cause.Nnmm.I can.That that's actually what I was thinking too (--).Either way um, you can either.Like leave and then come back to mine.Cause I want to give you.I think I want to give you this.Thank you.Ok.I do have a Helicopter Lift if.you know we'll see what happens but if we want to do that one.Yeah.We might need that at the end.Yeah.so we could save it (too).One of you has save it.Sh-she has a Helicopter Lift.Wait a minute.Either way you don't need these if you don't wanna do anything. You discard them, they're not important.anymore for you.Ch, ch.If I fly.to her.and I can give her one of these, she gots three of these. She can discard.yeah this is use once.One of those.Well y-.totally it's what I would do.Yeah.Right..And then what you could actually do.give it to her and you could fly both of you.Right. Because of the Helicopter..That's smart cause I can't do that name$$$~21:37:80.To there and then.And then she has three.I think.Alright.Can't you only fly once a turn?.Well.Actually no don't fly there, fly here..Um.Yeah do you want to fly me there?.Cause then I can get down there and give her this..Right..Cause I can f-.I can fly because I'm the pilot.One.and I can't cause if we.One, that's one (--) move.Just hold on.(--) move two so I give her that and this is discarded..And then I want to get rid of that yeah.Ok that makes sense.Ok and now (--) move three is I use.The Helicopter and I fly.(Well you can) discard that right there..Cool.The two of us.Cool.There.Thank you..Ok so now.Ok.We're at if you get those two.I on my turn, I'm gonna instantly grab this.Ok.Then I'm going to move down and give you this.Thank you.You'll finish that.And get rid of that one, cool.And then on your turn.Makes sense.Ok.You need no you need to then you on your turn you need to use your Helicopter Lift to get her.To get us out of.Oh I will.to red.That makes sense.And then you can just finish that off, cause you're- or you could just move there on your turn..Yeah.That's gonna be like, we might need that to save us all..Now.Here's the hard part. We gotta pull three..Yeah to get over here..Yeah.Ok.Hmm.Right.We might lose both of these. Like we'll see what happens. I don't know..Well.So this is where.We have to be really careful. What did you lose.Yeah.Silver Gate.Tidal Palace.Tidal Palace.what else?.And.Breakers.Breaker's Bridge.K.Ok so we're still good..Ok.Yee.For now.For now, ok my turn so.Now it's your turn.Capturing a treasure.Ah I'll take that.Now I'm gonna move down here..Cool.Give you that. Get rid of that.And then I will, I'm gonna just, can you do me a favor and discard that? Thank you..Um and that's all. That's all three of mine. By moving and then giving..Cool.Cool.Ah.And now you get two of these.We're actually on the same for all of us.So now you got that.Yeah we don't need..Ok so now you have four right?.Yeah got all four of these.Yeah so trade.Ok.I got five, I got the Helicopter.Ok well first I need to, I need to do.three? right. you need to do three..Oh yeah.That's.You shouldn't lose anything..Cause.Right..The ones (--) are all down there..Hmmm..Ah Bronze Gate.Cave of Shadows. It's (--) (risky).Dunes of Deception.There it is.Mmmhmm..Ok now this is a very critical move now. Now really think about this..Ok.Ok.I think.She could.Well she needs to gather the treasure right away.Yeah she needs to gather the treasure right away and then.Yeah.She could.t-.No.Who, what color are you?.Gray so I'm in.yeah.Yeah I agree you should gather the treasure because everything's flood now..Ok let me calculate this.Ok.one two one two one two (--).Ok.Here's what I think we should do.Sounds good.So if she gathers that treasure which is the first thing we should do so.Yeah I agree let's gather the treasure..Get rid of yours.She she has that Helicopter. She could actually fly us all..At least all three of us to here..I want to.And then with that.She still has well that.She has one ac.like she'll have one action left. Actually it doesn't even count as an action..Well right and she can flip two of them over..She can fly here.Yeah.and then save at least save this one, cause that's where you're gonna go.and then we'll put.Honestly I was.Mmhm..Right..thinking that on my own..Ok.cause then..When you're there.Ok so.You can gather this and then you're right here and then all we need to do.Yeah.Er.Is good.We have three treasures and we can leave. But we need to get a Helicopter..Yeah.Yeah.Ok so that's flat.Ok.Yeah.To get there.Ok.So you're gonna come here.Take that and then come here and then all we need is one of us to get a Helicopter and we can ga- and we can win.Cool.Ok.So I can draw my two treasure cards, that that was very smart..So.Flip this over..I have a pro.Hold up. What?.I have Helicopter Lift again but I have a.She flipped.Ok.what.For what? oh she meant no I don't think mean to do, just this one..Mm right, right we flipped that one..No.Yeah there.Ahh.I have a Helicopter Lift but I have a problem.

Team2901.csv,"Ok.Um.I'm thinking.I should probably.um.unflood.two of the tiles.um.prob-.You should probably do the one that has the thing on it.Mhmm.So I'll do Whispering Garden.and Gold Gate.So that's one action.and I have fire cards so I think I'm gonna start moving that way.I think you're allowed- only allowed to shore up one.Oh I have to be adjacent to it.Ok.Can you do two?.or.She can.Oh, ok.Because she's the Engineer.I can. I just have to be.Oh, you can. Alright..It's just the matter of the cards that she.shores up need to be next to her.Yeah.Adjacent, ok.So I'll do that then.and then.can move.See I wanna get down there.so probably move.this way and then.I have one more action so.guess I'll go this way.um.Can you hand me two treasure deck cards please?.Yep.ok.Um so a Water's Rise card.and.put that over there, please.and then flood cards.oops.so.this would go over there.and Whispering Garden.Okay.Oh.Guess I'll go that way.Alright.So.I guess I'll start.by.shoring up.Well I guess if I.move here first.and then I can.No wait, nevermind. I'll just do that.Um.let's see.Um.I guess I'll move here.uh.No.Do I have anything else to do?.I suppose.You have to do flood cards.Or treasure cards and flood cards, yeah, both.Yeah.Mmhmm.Ok so I got another one of those.and.I can shore up.any one tile on the island.Um.Sinking tile.I don't know. I guess I can save that.for a bit.Ok.Ok.um.You should shore- you should shore up that one before you have to flood it..Where is that?.Cities of abandon.Which one? The cities of abandon?.The cliffs, yeah..Oh ok..Oh the cliffs, yeah.So then this goes here.I don't think you can do that because this card, like, it was drawn so I think you would've had to do that before.Oh I didn't know if you could do that.Oh so it's just.done.Yeah.Ok.Ok.Sure.So that's out.and.I'll just go here.Mhmm.Ok.That's it.Ok.Um.I will just move.and.with my thing I can.go to any tile so it's not just slowly.Yeah.Mm.And now that I have one here so I'll just hang out here for a bit.till I can accumulate them.Or I was thinking maybe you should.Or, yeah.go here.and then you could flip.Oh ok, yeah.that for one of your actions.could do that.um.Or, like, the Watchtower.yeah.Because you can.because if you go down to the Watchtower.then you can flip an adjacent one.you mean?.Mmhmm.Oh, yeah, yeah. That's fine.And then you could still be there closely.Yeah.Sure.Ok.Uh.right.and that's.two.alright so more helicopters.and that.um.and then flood.and flood cards.So we have.Oh, good thinking.and.Where's the rock.Pretty much. Oh, we already, alright so this one's out.Ok.What does it mean when they have these little pieces on them?.I think that's just where we started.Yeah, I think it's the starting point.Oh, oh.Like the pawns start.Ok.And so this goes back.Mmhmm.Mmhmm.Hmmm.Ok.Um.So.I should.probably get down.to the.Yeah.Cave of Shadows.because I can't.um.shore up anything, really.um.Can you.I can use the helicopter.to get you there.Oh later.Right?.Isn't that.Is that what you mean?.Or now.Can you give her this or is that only something that I can do?.No she can but it has to be on her turn.Ok.Yeah.So I guess.Yeah like, like I.If you wanted to get there I can give this to you on my turn.Ok.Well I was just thinking for like my one turn I could give.her the.Chalice.Chalice.Oh ok.Or, wait, where's the.purple one.Purple is either above or below.Mmhmm.Ok so I guess it's close I was gonna say because the fire's here and the Chalice so I can.Mhmm.give this to you.and then.And what are you-, are you gonna move to here then? And then she can give that to you on her turn?.Mmhmm.Oh ok.Yep.Give a single card to another player.Oh who is standing on the same tile as you. Ok, nevermind..Ok.So.Oh, I have a trip to get there.Ok.Ok.If.What color are you-, is this you?.that were the case.Mmhmm.Yeah.Ok so.Then maybe on.your turn.you can fly down and then.can you, like.give card.I can.Me? I can give treasure cards to a player anywhere on the island for one action per card.Which I don't know what that means. One action per card.Yeah.So it's just like a one to one thing. Like one of your actions will be doing that exchange.Ok.So that's an action.Mmhmm.Yeah.Ok.Ok.Wait so you're trying to get to here. You can just.go here.Yeah I was gonna give her a tile. I was just thinking.Oh ok.the best way to do.Yeah, I'll just go.because.you have.a card that I need and which, this is you right?.Yeah, so I could, yeah.Ok.Come over and do that. So I'll do that and then.I could- yeah.Mmhmm.Yeah, I guess we'll just do that.This sound good? Cause there's really no point in me doing anything else.Ok.Mmhmm.Yeah, I agree.Yep.That's fine.Ok.Yep.Oh dang, nice.Oh.great.There we go.Ok.I hope.that doesn't sink.Yeah, I know right.in the next two turns.Ok, Temple of the Moon, oof.and Iron Gate.Oh.That's gold.S-.Uh, Iron Gate.Oh.Ok.At least it's on the periphery.Ok.Yep.Ok.Alright.Alright, yeah.So, now.I'm like so far away.and, I mean I guess I can.(Ee).If I p- can move up there then I can flip that back over, like eventually.Mmhmm.Mmhmm.You just might need to take like.Um.two or three turns to do that..Yeah.Cause I can only move once at a time.Ok.Ok, maybe you could.give the.Chalice to me because I'll be.close here.Mmhmm.If the next one like.turns up, you mean?.But you-.But again, you have to be on the same tile to give the cards, remember?.Oh right.Or no you do- you don't- you don't have to, yeah..No but I can give it to anyone.Oh.Yeah.Yeah, ok.So we could do that, and then.you should probably- because we're gonna have to.I mean I'm gonna have to start moving anyway. It might as well be sooner rather than later because I'm stuck here like.Mmhmm.And you can only, yeah.Mmhmm.Oh, so I have to discard one, ok.Oh you have to discard.Well.you can discard that one because you don't have anything accumulated.Yeah.Mmhmm.Ok.Where does that go?.It goes in the treasure pile? I think, yeah.Ok.Treasure pile.Do these never come back though?.If we like run through the deck I think we'll reshuffle it or something but yeah.Oh ok, also it doesn't matter cause you have treasure cards anyway.Ok.Yeah.Ok.So.Yeah, cause I'm cornered.Mmhmm.So I have to.Yeah and remember this is a diagonal. You can't move diagonally.start.Right, I have to start moving anyway.So.yeah.So that's one.So that's one.that was two.You have.and then, I can.up to three.I don't have anything else to do, I suppose.Maybe you could use the sandbag card to save this just in case we have to.Mmhmm.Yeah.Because.I think that would be really wise.It has a thing on it, ok.Yeah, shuffle and it comes up again.And that's the way you're- you're going toward that anyway, yeah.Good idea.So.Ok.Ok, cool.Alright, so treasures and water.Ok, Water's Rise.Oh.What do I do again? Oh put these on top.Um.Mmm.And then you have to draw three of them, yeah.And I have to pick three.Three.Ok.Um.So this.didn't do anything.Mmm.But I guess it did, because it would have been sunk.Great.Yeah, that's true.Um.The Iron Gate.Iron gate is sunk.Iron just goes away.here give me the card.Done.for the.Iron Gate, yeah.Oh, my bad, yeah.Mm.And the Gold Gate.Golden Gate is sunk.Alright.And this goes.here.Mmhmm.This is mine? Alright.Mmkay.So um, you needed or someone needed to be lifted.Who was that?.No.I don't think we were gonna do that. I think you were gonna give me the fire card.Not anymore, yeah.Yeah.As one.Ok.great.Great and then.And well, I- I needed to be over here to do that.Well you have to discard one.Ok.Here I needed to be over here to do that, too, but here.moved.Give a single card to another player standing on the same.Yep.Oh same.I just- I just moved.Oh ok.so it's fine.Ok, but you still have to discard.And then.I guess.get rid of that.Um, let's see.Um.Really.Do you need to go anywhere?.Is there anything that you can do?.I mean.Cause I already have another one of these cards, I guess.Um.Like I only have two of these right now anyway so.Mmhmm.I don't think that that would help much.Yeah because like on your next turn even you could just move over and then.Yeah, like, might as well save those if you need 'em so you could just continue with.Unsink it.Yeah.Ok.Cool.Alright.Um.Picking I guess.I think that's all I need to.Treasure cards.do in this round.Yeah.So I've got.this. And I think that's six.So I will.Oh.Discard one of the heli-.cause it's just, I have two of 'em.Yeah.Um and then.floods.so three.Alright so we have.where's.Howling Garden.Lost Lagoon.It sunk.Ok.and Whispering Garden.Ok.Ok.And these go back.Ok.So I wanna get.the treasure first. I can just do that.You need to trade 'em.Yeah.right now.Mmhmm.And these cards just go back in the pile I guess.And I just take this.Yeah.Ok.Um.Ok.And then.I can move over and then unsink that.So you're here.Think I'll just do that.and then.Oops, can you flip that please?.Mmhmm.Ok.Um can you hand me treasure cards?.Thank you.Ok.Um and then.three flood cards.Ok so we have four of these up now.so.I guess.on.your guys's next turns see if you can give 'em to me and.We need to consolidate.Yeah.Mmhmm.then you could f-.maybe.(--) I mean.Maybe on your next turn you could first fly me to like one of the- oh, well I guess that's right there but.Mmhmm.Yeah.Yeah.So I'll-, I'll move here next and then I can move there and collect it.Because we're gonna have to.Mmhmm.Yeah.Ok.Yeah and we're going to have to un-.flip this too, at some point.Yeah, and that one.And, and that. Yeah.Mmhmm.I mean I can use a sandbags to do that so.And you have sandbags.Ok, where's Crimson F-.Forest is up there.Ok.So we have Crimson Forest, Copper Gate.and Cave of Embers.Which isn't really important anymore.Right.Ok cool.Good?.Mmhmm.Ok.So I'm moving here.Um.I guess I-.gonna shore up this.Mmhmm.Oh wait.before you do that.Yeah.Maybe you should like, shore up this one and then move over and then shore up.Or did you, were you going to do something else?.Can I do that?.Wait, I think you, like one move is like one.I think so.action so you can only do three actions, right?.Yeah, cause like.So I can- this would- could my first.flipping that would be one.and then over.two.(--).Three.three.Three.Ok.Ok.Well that was good.Um.Yeah.Now.Ok.So.Water's Rise.And this is not really.And then.Three flood cards.important.not anymore.Ok, so we have Copper Gate sunk.That's done.Whispering Garden.done.Alright, Howling Garden.Cool.Can you hand me the Copper Gate card?.Yeah.Thanks.Ok.So, it's your turn.Ok.Um.So now you wanna give me one of these.Did-.yes.So you have to fly to her.Oh right.Right?.Oh.Yeah.Does sh-.You have to be on the same.Cause she has to be on the same.Or is your special power?.Or.you can give them to any-.one.No, that's mine.Ok.You're right. So she's gotta fly to me.Ok, so I have to go here.or, yeah, go here.And then give you this.Is that.Give that to you.of an action for you.Um.to fly anywhere?.Yes it is an action. So that's one, two.Ok.So that's two.Two.and then.Shh-.Three is a.Um.You should.Yeah.You can't flip over a diagonal, can you? You can't shore up a diagonal?.I can use sand-.Ooh.Um.But this is any one, any tile it says, for sandbags so.Oh.Yeah, maybe you should.shore up.either this one or that one.Yeah, either or.But.I'm thinking this one is kind of.going to be isol-.I was just about to say the same thing. I think you should do this one.It's-.Yeah, isolated.Yeah.Mmhmm.Cause we've gotta keep these guys in play anyway.Ok.Yeah.Mmhmm yeah, Fool's Landing.Alright so here's my three.Cool.More helicopters.Did you discard sandbag?.Uh.yes.Ok.Um.and then.And then three.Alright.So.Cave is done.Ok, that's ok.We've already got that one.And forest, where's our Crimson Forest?.Up here.Oh, crimson is also done.K.Oh so we're, we're s-.stranded, basically.Little bit.You can fly someone else with you, right?.Yes.Yeah, cause, especially cause, yeah.Ok.As long as you're on.On the same.tile.Ok.Yeah.Um.So.Just this.can't sink.So you need to give me this.Ok.Oh.as one of 'em.Oh well you can shore up the temple right now.No I have to be adjacent to it.I can.Aren't you, oh you're red. Oh, my bad. I thought you were blue.shore up two, yeah.No, she's red. Yeah.yeah.I can't give that to you because.Ok.Mmhmm.I have to like.Yeah.be up with you.Mmhmm.Yeah.Well.Um.Oh, and she can't fly you.No.Oh.Is there anything?.Shoot.Um I'll probably.just like move on to the.Coral Palace so I'm.there.I think.Can you move diagonal?.Yeah, well just like one, two.Oh.And.I thought you can only do one space, though.I think, isn't it?.One space per action?.Yeah so that would be two actions.Ok.You just moved up, two actions, yeah.Yeah.and.I can only shore up adjacent, I can't shore up diagonal..So I think that's probably it.Oh dang.Oh great..That was.Look at that..Cool.Cool.Can you just get that no? Or are those one of your actions to get the treasure, yeah, ok..That's another action..Yeah that's an-.I have to wait till.Well yeah, now you know for next.next turn.hopefully..Oh boy.Ok.Coral Palace.Oh.Mm.Dune of Deception.and Silver Gate..Mmkay.um.Ok.It's your turn.Yeah.So.it's my turn..Um, why not shore up this..Mm good call.Yes.Um.And I'm- Well I don't really.Let me think.I don't have to be on that tile to collect the treasure there, do I?.I think you do, yeah..Yeah.Ok, so I might as well move..Yep.(--).And.um.And I'll move with you on my turn so that we can Helicopter out..at some point.Yeah.Good call.Cause we can't go..Is there any reason that we need to like.keep the Silver Gate?.No because you're.Uh.(--).Yeah.stranded anyway..Yeah because that's an island..Yeah.Well I was thinking.Well who can move diagonal?.No one.Oh.None of us- No.cause we're not that guy..We're not playing the Explorer, yeah..Wait because on your turn.Oh wait.On my turn we're gonna go somewhere else..nevermind..Yeah I was gonna say.because I have to.give her this card at some point..Yeah so on her turn she needs to fly you.to me.But I have to be here to get.that..so- Unless.Oh.On your turn you could fly.Everyone to the chalice thing?.No cause we're on, all in different places..You could fly to get.Oh.Oh wait, no.becuase that would be one,.What I could do is I could move me one.two,.fly over.three..Yeah.Because you could fly to me, take me there, and then take me.Mmhmm.back..Take all of us back, you mean..Mmhmm.Yeah.Yup, yup, that could work..Ok.Well no you would have to stay there..She- Well she could move here.Mmhmm.Well wait how am I getting the thing then?.Yeah I was gonna say like she could come down, get me, take me up.Yeah.so I can give you this card.and then.take me back so I can get the.But can't you just give me that card on your turn- Oh well then your turn will be next but then she couldn't.Coral Palace..fly you back, because can't you only give me.Mmm.that card when it's your turn?.No we have to be on the same.Mmhmm.tile..You can give cards anywhere on your turn but she can't give to you..Yeah but like.Yeah but like I'm saying don't you have to wait to give me.that card until it's your turn, or can you give it at.Yeah.Mmhmm.So like.Yeah.No.she's gonna fly you.Oh, I see what you're saying..here and then you're not gonna be able to do anything..Mmhmm.Mmhmm.Ok, yeah we'll just have to wait then, so we can get that, because it's gonna sink..So the only thing that we can do is just keep 'em from sinking until we go around again..Mmhmm.So.Yup.Can you shore up the tile you're on, not just an adjacent one, or.Ok.I think you can shore up the tile you're on..Yeah you can..So.That might be a good.yeah.so.Yeah.your next turn, you're gonna give.me that.I'm.and then it'll be.your-.and then I can.get it and then.her turn will be again and then you could-.and we could get you for- get you that.Well on her turn she can also do this. If she gives you that card she can also get the treasure on her turn..Mmhmm.So she doesn't need to stay on this tile, necessarily..No I can.shore it up.Yeah.and then- Yeah, because then.And then- Oh cause you-.And get it..I see..Yeah.Yeah.So.do you first.Yeah.becuase you're already there, you're like primed..Ok.Alright.It's still your turn right?.Cool, yes..Ok.Mmhmm.It's still my turn but I'm not doing anything more, I'm just gonna do this..Yeah.Yup.Ok.Ok, yes.and then we can get rid of the.chalice, cause you can only have five, yeah..Oh yeah, cause you already have four..Mmhmm yeah.Alright.And then.water tiles..Ok let's see. Temple of the Sun,.Tidal Palace,.and Bronze Gate..It's here..Ok.Um.That wasn't so bad,.I suppose..Ok.so I'm going.to just go ahead and get the chalice.Wait, it's her turn.Oh sorry.oh I do need to go, yeah.keep thinking we're going this way..Um so I can move up here so we can Helicopter.um that's the only thing I know for sure..Well.Wait, no.we don't need to Helicopter anymore, I guess..No.You need to- If anything, you would need to Helicopter to her- go to her, so that she could Helit- copter.the two of you can come to me and give me this..Yeah.So you wanna go here.Ok.Well first you should maybe.if anything..shore up- Wait,.because that would be.one,.Yeah, wait so you're standing here right now.two.right?.Yeah.Yeah, ok, I'm trying to think. So you could like shore this up, would be one..And then two, and then three..Or move to it.shore.One.Move to that and then shore this up, do you mean?.But I don't need to- I don't need to shore it..Yeah.Just in case.Cause you still- We still need to get.you guys together.Yeah.and I'm the only one who can do that- who can do that..But I'm.thinking if you move here and then shore this up.Mmhmm.that would be two and then.you could fly to me..And then the third one to fly to you..Yeah.But you two need to be together, not me and you, right?.Yeah.Yeah so you're coming to her so that you two can come.but I have to get this on my turn..Yeah.Ok.Oh ok, yep, alright cool..So.Mmhmm.This one.No, no, no, flip this.Yeah.Um.And then you can fly to me.That would be three..But you can't- I wasn't, I wasn't adjacent to that..Yeah.Yeah but you moved here.that's one turn..Ok.and then you flipped this, that's two. And then fly to her.Two.Oh ok.and then you can fly to me..Ok.That's three.Yeah.Cool.Ok.Ok.Ok so.How do I have seven? I don't understand that.Um well anyhow, I guess I needed to.get rid of two becuase.Yeah you can get rid of those two..Yeah.So and then floods.Oh we kinda played that wrong..Um.What do we do?.I think it's too late to go back but.I think she should've just come here to like.flip that cause like.Oh.we could (be) screwed right now..Well I think it's, I think it's still in here..(--) there might be two..Ok well we're good..Alright.I could see that.Wait.Um.I think right?.Yeah, cool.So.Over- Where's Watchtower? I think Watchtower's already over. No it's not..And then.Marsh..Ok, that was kinda safe..Ok.Good.Ok.so your Helicopter.the Lift, you can.either fly like a whole group of people if you're on the same tile.or you could just like.use it to fly one person somewhere, right?.Um.Like.Does she has-.But she doesn't have to be with them? Use to fly one or more.Yeah I think that's.Right?.other adventureres who are on the same.It just- Yeah, it just says.(--).Yeah.So you can fly yourself and others to the same tile..Ok.So I could- I could like give this to someone to do, basically? Yeah.Yeah.basically, yeah, ok..Yeah.So I'm gonna go ahead and do.this, which is great. Ok so that's one turn..And then.I can't give you this until my next turn.so.Wait, why?.Because we're not on the same tile..Yeah, we have to be on the same tile..Oh my god, I keep forgetting that..Or you could use your Helicopter Lift.Mmhmm.right now to get me up there..To fly her.Oh ok, I didn't know if I needed it to use it on my turn..Oh.Helicopter Lift.you do have to.Yes, that's what we were waiting for before..Yeah.use it on your turn..Yeah.Ok.I.So.think that's all. Should I shore it up?.Are you.Yeah.Yeah.I might as well just shore it up because I'm.here because we don't need the other ones, and then.that's probably good.Ok.Ok so I have a Lift,.Water Rise..Move it up.No these ones.go on top of that..Mmhmm.Oh.And they all get shuffled and.Yeah.We.pull three..Ok now I pull three..Mmhmm.Yup.Ok.Tidal Palace is sunk..Ok.Well.yeah, ok, never mind..Temple of the Sun.Cause you're gonna have to fly me somewhere to get to the main land.Mmhmm.Yup.and.Oh yeah, Misty March.Ok.Alright.So.You should probably shore that up.Mmhmm.Yeah.first..(--).Yeah.Um.And then.Wait, what just happened with this?.Well.on.Oh becuase you're not with me. Why do I keep forgetting that? I'm so dumb..her turn.Yeah.Mmhmm.Ok.I'm screwed.so.I can't do anything..Yeah.Um, we don't need either of these.Oh wait that f-.that flood tile goes here..Yeah.Ok.Ok Observatory is sunk.Watchtower is sunk..And.Bronze Gate.is also sunk..Ee we'll need those Helicopters.Ok.So I am flying who where?.Her to me.The two of us to there..Mmkay.Yeah.So everyone, everyone goes here is what you're saying? Yeah ok.Does that count as.Yeah.Does that count as- That's one action right?.That's just one..Uh no.the Helicopter doesn't count as an action.Well, no, you can fly.you can fly me, becuase that's your special power..Ye-.You don't need to use that..Yeah, but this counts as an action, this doesn't..Is she allowed to take someone with her though?.In this? Yeah.No for this..Oh.No..Well.Oh.one person- one per turn..This is just- this is just me, flying around..Oh ok.So and that counts as an action for me but this doesn't, and the.Ok, yeah, so we need to do that..Yeah..So.that stays..Ok.Um.Wait, so you don't have to get rid of one of these now?.Yeah.Oh I, I do need to get rid of it, I just played it, yeah, ok..Yeah, ok, I just got confused..I think that's all we were going to do.Yeah I think that's all that can happen right now..Because.Yeah.Unless you wanna fly-.Wait ok, so we're not gonna need that tile, we're not gonna need this tile, we're not.gonna really need this.Mmhmm.tile because.And we only need three of these treasures right? And so we're gonna get that on her next turn cause you're gonna give that to her.Mmhmm.um and she'll be able to claim it.Yeah.Maybe.Then that'll be the-.and then we all just need to get back here..Yeah.Ok since maybe.True.So if we all hang tight, basically in this spot, we should be ok..And then you could fly us all together..Yeah.But we need one of those cards to leave Fool's Landing..One of these cards?.Yeah.so Oh.Mmm.So maybe.Yeah.So she can only fly hers-.herself there, I see..Well what you- You have that. So what you can do.Oh if she gets us all off here.Mmhmm.is you can fly us all, you can fly us all here. And then.one of us can get us home..Yeah.We- Well you can't do that yet, because we still have to get her treasure..Yes.So it would be like another two rounds and.basically like crossing your fingers that nothing we need sinks..So.Well, it would only be- So in the next.Yeah.Wait who's turn is it about to be?.Yours?.Mine..Yours.Ok so.you give me that.Mmhmm, so that counts as one turn..Um.oh right because then we can't evaucate until I get the thing..Mmhmm.Mmhmm.Yeah.Ok.Yup.Ok I see what you're saying..So.So yeah..Alright, well let's.Oh yeah, do I need treasures? Yeah..Yeah.It's still her turn..Oh.Gosh.Yeah so I need- Yeah.damn. Sorry..So, cool.Alright yeah..You can get rid of the chalice..Can I have three of those lovely, lovely things..So Moon, where's Moon? So Moon gets flipped..Up here.Garden gets flipped and.oh both Gardens get flipped..Oh.Alright.so.and back..Ok.Ok.so.Ok let's.your turn..make that move.Purple goes.My turn, I'm giving this to you.Mmhmm.and then.You should shore up here, so we don't all sink.I have to discard this..with nowhere to go..which is kind of unfortunate because.Yeah.Oh, yeah.Oh actually it doesn't matter if I get this, it'll be the third.Yeah cause we already- We'll have three. Yeah.Yeah, ok, I was thinking maybe.instead of shoring that up.because I can't really- it's not gonna sink.Is it in here?.Mmhmm.Yeah, it's on the top. So it's not gonna.Oh Temple of the Moon..It's not going to sink because I would have to like shuffle them, put them on top. Cause I do that.Unless you get a Water R-.Yeah it's possible that you could get a Water Rise card and have to do that..And then have it be on top?.Do you shuffle it first and then.Yeah, you shuffle them and then you put 'em all on top..And then put it on top and then.pull it?.Ok so.So it's kinda risky..So, I would, I would shore it up..Why wouldn't you flip it?.Well I was thinking.becuase these are.both at risk to sink..I could- Well no.These you mean?.Like what are?.These two which are the- We have to have those to get the.Oh.But we don't need that third one if we-.Or that fourth one if we get the third..Yeah, we only need three treasures. So we, we just need to get back here, we just need to get back here..Mmhmm.Oh, we only need three, ok..Yeah, so.So yeah, then I'll just shore this up.Shore it.Yeah.and then.that's it..Alright.Ok.Ok well.Ok and then.three so, Silver Gate is sunk..Dunes of Deception is sunk..Coral Palace is flipped..Cool.Alright so you keep your Helicopter card,.I'll move us all here.Yeah.and then.you take off..Mmhmm.That's how we win..Alright.Ok.So I'm gonna take this baby.Alright, cool..and I am not gonna do anything else..You have to- treasure cards..You still have to do treasures and floods..Yeah.I meant like action. Alright so that is that. Water's.Rise..No.Oh boy.Yeah.Four cards.Alright so.Ok.Ok you have to shuffle those..So I'll shuffle.Ok that makes it easier that we only need.Mmhmm.I feel like it'd be really hard to do if we needed to get all four, I don't think it'd be like.It's just that (--) possible..Yeah.So we have.Ok.Whispering.Did you take.four?.Ok.Yes..Whispering Garden.is done..So that's done..Temple of the Moon.is flipped..Ok.I was like whoa.thanks.Mmkay.Um.Temple of the Sun.Gone..Done..is gone.And Coral Palace is done.It's gone..Alright.How have we never picked a Fool's Landing card?.I don't know..Maybe there just aren't-.I know.Yeah I don't know..Maybe they're at the bottom..Alright so we are flying..Yes, we're flying..Get rid of that..And that's all we're doing..Yeah.So.Yeah and then, take your treasure cards..yup..Just discard this guy, it doesn't matter.and.Four.Four.Guess that just goes on top and then.Wait were there not four in there already?.You have to put these ones back on top, right?.No cause the waters didn't rise..Yeah.Oh, oh, oh.So it's just the next four, so it's fine..Yeah.You're right, sorry..Alright, so, one, two, three, four..Mmm there's a Fool's Landing..Um all remaining things flip..Ok.So the- this is gone.and that one's gone..Um this one's done..Is this one done?.Mmhmm, it was flipped..But we didn't draw that card..I thought you said all remaining things.No I, I mispoke..Oh I thought it was like a card that said.So yeah we flip.That's this one, yeah..or.Yeah that gets flipped..Yeah that's done..Yeah.Ok.And we can still exit when it's flipped, right? Or no?.Yeah.Mmhmm.I think so..Ok.I think, yeah..So.Well I could flip it anyway, so.Yeah, and then this guy- Or did we just flip this? Yeah. Yeah that's, I guess done..We.Doesn't matter..Um what was that?.Uh I don't.We flipped all of them so like.Yeah we just flipped all of them.Oh we just flipped them, ok, yeah so that's- Alright that can still stay..Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was still here..Yeah.Yeah.Ok.Alright, so that's, that's that. These are the.flood cards..Ok so now it's my turn right?.Yeah.And just leave. Yeah we're done..Ok I'll just flip this, in case cause I'm not sure if it has to be flipped over or not, but we'll do that..Yup.Yeah, and then use your Helicopter and we win..I don't know either..And then.yeah Helicopter goes over there and.yay..Alright, done..Cool.",u,b  %  sd  sd  %  b  sd  %  b  sv  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  qy  %  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd
